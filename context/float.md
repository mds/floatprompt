# Context

Onboarding documents for bringing fresh AI sessions up to speed on FloatPrompt.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **floatprompt-context.txt** | Master context document. Upload to any AI for instant FloatPrompt understanding. |

## Purpose

When starting a fresh AI session, upload `floatprompt-context.txt` to give the AI comprehensive understanding of:

- What FloatPrompt is
- The core distinction (behavior vs. context)
- When to use FloatPrompt vs. plain Markdown
- Goal hierarchy and principles
- MDS methodology

## Usage

```
1. Start new AI session
2. Upload floatprompt-context.txt
3. AI instantly understands FloatPrompt
4. Continue working
```

This is lighter than uploading the full `floatprompt-os.txt` when you just need context, not tool-building capability.

---

For full tool-building capability, use `floatprompt.txt` or `floatprompt-os.txt` from root.
