# Context

Onboarding documents for bringing fresh AI sessions up to speed on the FloatPrompt system.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **float-context.md** | Master context document. Upload to any AI for instant understanding of the full system. |

## Purpose

When starting a fresh AI session, upload `float-context.md` to give the AI comprehensive understanding of:

- The three components (FloatDoc, FloatPrompt, FloatSystem)
- When to use each component
- Goal hierarchy and principles
- MDS methodology
- Core distinctions (context vs. behavior vs. awareness)

## Usage

```
1. Start new AI session
2. Upload float-context.md
3. AI instantly understands the full FloatPrompt system
4. Continue working
```

This is lighter than uploading the full `floatprompt-os.md` when you just need context, not tool-building capability.

For full tool-building capability, use `floatprompt.md` or `floatprompt-os.md` from root.
