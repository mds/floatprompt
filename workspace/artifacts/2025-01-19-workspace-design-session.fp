# üìÅ Workspace Architecture Design Session Extract

**Preserved intelligence from workspace structure design conversation**

## üéØ Key Breakthroughs

### **Framework-Quality Standards**
- Moved from "Next.js-level" references to standalone "framework-quality" language
- Established convention over configuration as core principle
- Zero config by default with obvious folder purposes

### **File Type Clarity**
- All artifacts created through FloatPrompt should be `.fp` files
- Only pure documentation remains as `.md` files
- Examples needed specific category comments (`# voice example`, `# style example`)

### **Structural Simplification**
- Eliminated confusing `frameworks/` subfolder
- Moved all executable tools to `deploy/` regardless of type
- Clear distinction: `deploy/` = executable, `support/` = reference

## üèóÔ∏è Design Decisions

### **Folder Organization**
```
workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _USAGE.md          # Single source of truth (floats to top)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artifacts/         # Session records (.fp files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy/           # Production tools (.fp files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lab/              # Experiments (.fp files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ support/          # Reference materials (.fp files)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vendor/           # Third-party tools (.fp files)
```

### **Comment System Evolution**
1. **Started**: Generic `# example` comments
2. **Enhanced**: Specific `# exe example`, `# method example`, `# doc example`
3. **Refined**: Category-specific `# voice example`, `# style example`, `# vocab example`

### **Visual Formatting Breakthrough**
- Added vertical spacing between major sections
- Created scannable, professional appearance
- Maintained clean alignment and hierarchy

## üéØ Strategic Insights

### **Implementation Philosophy**
- Transform documentation into live implementation
- Enable dogfooding of own workspace architecture
- Provide copy-paste ready examples for users
- Create reference standard through actual use

### **Developer Experience Priorities**
- Immediate clarity over complex explanations
- Convention over configuration
- Path of least resistance for correct usage
- Framework-quality design principles

### **Quality Standards**
- All `.fp` files should be functional examples
- Structure must demonstrate best practices
- Examples should showcase real usage patterns
- Maintain consistency with FloatPrompt naming conventions

## üîÑ Evolution Path

1. **Documentation Phase**: Created external workspace architecture
2. **Refinement Phase**: Improved file types, comments, formatting
3. **Implementation Phase**: Transform into live workspace structure
4. **Validation Phase**: Use structure in actual development

## üí° Wisdom Preserved

**Core Insight**: The best way to teach workspace organization is to demonstrate it through actual use, not just describe it through documentation.

**Design Principle**: Make correct usage the path of least resistance through obvious folder names and clear conventions.

**Quality Standard**: Framework-quality means users immediately understand what goes where without reading extensive documentation.

**This session established the foundation for FloatPrompt workspace architecture that embodies the same design excellence users expect from modern development frameworks.**
