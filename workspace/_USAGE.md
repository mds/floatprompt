# üìÅ FloatPrompt Workspace Usage

**Single source of truth for workspace workflow and organization**

## üéØ Quick Start

1. **Organize your FloatPrompts** using the folder structure below
2. **Start in lab/** for experimentation and development
3. **Graduate to deploy/** when tools are production-ready
4. **Support with materials** in support/ for enhanced execution
5. **Preserve intelligence** in artifacts/ for future reference

## üìÇ Folder Purposes

### `artifacts/` - Session Records & Development History
- **Purpose**: Historical documentation and development records
- **Contents**: `.fp` files from FloatPrompt sessions, decision records, breakthrough moments
- **Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.fp`
- **Example**: `2025-01-19-workspace-design-session.fp`

### `deploy/` - Production-Ready Tools
- **Purpose**: Tested, reliable FloatPrompts ready for regular use
- **Contents**: `.fp` files that are proven and team-approved
- **Quality Standard**: Must work reliably across different contexts
- **Graduation**: Successful experiments from lab/ move here

### `lab/` - Active Development & Experimentation
- **Purpose**: Work-in-progress FloatPrompts and testing
- **Contents**: Experimental `.fp` files, iterations, rapid prototyping
- **Freedom**: Creative exploration without quality constraints
- **Naming**: Can use dates for experiments or descriptive names

### `support/` - Supporting Materials
- **Purpose**: Reference materials that enhance FloatPrompt execution
- **Organization**:
  - `voice/` - Voice guides and tone references
  - `style/` - Design frameworks and brand guidelines
  - `vocabulary/` - Terminology dictionaries and glossaries
- **Integration**: Soft-coded references from FloatPrompts
- **Graceful degradation**: FloatPrompts work without, better with

### `vendor/` - Third-Party Tools
- **Purpose**: External FloatPrompt frameworks and dependencies
- **Contents**: `.fp` files from other creators or organizations
- **Maintenance**: External updates don't affect custom tools
- **Integration**: Referenced by custom FloatPrompts when needed

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### **Daily Development**
1. **Capture insights** ‚Üí `artifacts/` (preserve immediately)
2. **Experiment** ‚Üí `lab/` (rapid development)
3. **Test and refine** ‚Üí `lab/` (iteration)
4. **Deploy proven tools** ‚Üí `deploy/` (production ready)
5. **Create supporting materials** ‚Üí `support/` (enhance execution)

### **Quality Standards**
- **artifacts/**: Complete preservation, no editing
- **lab/**: No quality constraints, focus on learning
- **deploy/**: Must work reliably, tested across contexts
- **support/**: Clear, reusable reference materials
- **vendor/**: Document source and integration methods

## üéØ Best Practices

### **File Naming**
- Use descriptive, kebab-case names
- Include dates for artifacts and experiments
- Keep deploy/ names functional and clear

### **Voice Preservation**
- All `.fp` files maintain original human voice
- Support materials preserve source thinking
- Artifacts capture complete session intelligence

### **Team Collaboration**
- Share deploy/ tools across team members
- Use support/ for common reference materials
- Maintain artifacts/ for knowledge transfer

### **Workspace Maintenance**
- Regular graduation from lab/ to deploy/
- Archive old experiments to artifacts/
- Keep support/ materials current and useful
