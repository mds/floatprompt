# Restructure Reconciliation Tool

Cross-reference source captions, territorial map, and restructured lesson to identify and fix content gaps with surgical precision.

## Quick Start
Provide three files: (1) source captions, (2) territorial map, (3) restructured lesson. Tool identifies educationally relevant content missing from restructure and outputs specific edits to complete the document.

## Goals
- Identify content present in source but missing from restructure
- Use territorial map as contextual anchor for significance
- Determine optimal placement by theme fit
- Output surgical edits that preserve existing structure
- Maintain archaeological voice preservation in all additions

## Context
Standalone tool called after restructuring step. Fixes coverage gaps without requiring human review. Ensures no educationally relevant teaching moments are lost in the pipeline.

## Input Requirements

**File 1: Source Captions**
- SRT format transcript with timestamps
- Contains all original teaching content

**File 2: Territorial Map**
- Output from Content Territory Mapper
- Provides Key Moments and section boundaries
- Serves as significance filter

**File 3: Restructured Lesson**
- Output from Lesson Restructuring Tool
- Document to be reconciled and edited

## Processing Instructions

1. **Parse restructure** - catalog all existing `**MDS:**` quotes and their timestamps
2. **Parse map** - extract all Key Moments with timestamps and content
3. **Parse source** - identify all timestamped content blocks
4. **Cross-reference map → restructure**:
   - For each Key Moment in map, verify corresponding content exists in restructure
   - Flag any Key Moments not represented in restructure
5. **Cross-reference source → restructure** (using map as guide):
   - Identify source content that appears significant but is missing from both map Key Moments AND restructure
   - Apply educational relevance test: Does it support student design education or relate to lesson topic?
6. **Classify gaps**:
   - Map gaps: Content in map Key Moments but not in restructure
   - Source gaps: Educationally relevant content missed by entire pipeline
7. **Determine placement** for each gap:
   - Identify best-fitting existing teaching theme section
   - If no theme fits, plan new theme section creation
8. **Generate surgical edits**:
   - Format each addition in canonical restructure style
   - Specify exact insertion point (after which existing element)
   - Include complete formatted content ready to insert
9. **Output edit instructions** in executable format

## Output Format

```markdown
# Restructure Reconciliation Report

**Source:** [filename]
**Map:** [filename]  
**Restructure:** [filename]

## Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: [Brief description]
**Source timestamp:** [MM:SS]
**Classification:** Map gap / Source gap
**Reason:** [Why this is educationally relevant]

---

## Edits Required

### Edit 1: Insert new teaching point
**Location:** In section "[Theme Name]", after "### [MM:SS] [Existing Point Title]"
**Insert:**

### [MM:SS] [New Teaching Point Title]
[Context sentence explaining capability developed]

**MDS:** "[Exact quote preserving teaching voice]"

---

### Edit 2: Create new theme section
**Location:** After section "## [Existing Theme]"
**Insert:**

## [New Theme Name]

### [MM:SS] [Teaching Point Title]
[Context sentence]

**MDS:** "[Exact quote]"

---

## Summary
- Gaps identified: [N]
- Edits required: [N]
- New sections created: [N]

---
*Reconciled by [AI_MODEL]*
```

## Gap Classification Rules

**IS a gap (must recover):**
- Teaching frameworks or methodologies
- Design principles or reasoning
- Specific techniques or approaches
- Mindset shifts or professional identity moments
- Course philosophy or learning approach statements
- Concrete examples that illustrate concepts

**NOT a gap (skip):**
- "So before we get started..."
- "All right, so..."
- "You know what I mean?"
- Pure greetings without substantive content
- Repetition of points already captured
- Transitional phrases between topics

## Placement Decision Tree

1. Does content fit an existing teaching theme?
   - YES → Insert in that section, maintaining rough chronological order
   - NO → Continue to step 2

2. Does content represent a distinct teaching concept?
   - YES → Create new teaching theme section
   - NO → Append to most thematically adjacent section

3. For new theme sections:
   - Position based on content flow (usually chronological relative to other themes)
   - Use descriptive theme name that captures teaching focus

## Warnings
- Never paraphrase teaching voice - use exact quotes only
- Never remove or modify existing restructure content
- Don't create gaps for pure conversational filler
- Verify quote accuracy against source captions before including
- Maintain canonical formatting exactly (heading levels, attribution format, spacing)
- If uncertain whether content is educationally relevant, include it (err toward completeness)
