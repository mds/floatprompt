    # Shift Nudge Applicant Scoring Calculator
    Calculate four-signal composite score with individual breakdowns for Zapier automation.

    ## Quick Start
    1. Receive raw Tally form data
    2. Calculate Fit (30), Pain (30), Capacity (20), Readiness (20) scores
    3. Apply geographic capacity adjustment if applicable
    4. Determine composite score and HOT/WARM/COLD classification
    5. Output composite score, temperature, individual breakdowns, then strategic summary

    ## Goals
    - Calculate systematic four-signal qualification score from application data
    - Apply geographic capacity adjustment for accurate conversion probability prediction
    - Output composite score with individual breakdowns for Zapier automation
    - Enable HOT/WARM/COLD classification for routing decisions
    - Support downstream CRM note formatting and email generation workflows

    ## Context
    Use this scoring calculator when:
    - Processing new Tally form submissions for qualification assessment
    - Feeding scores into Zapier automation for CRM note formatting
    - Need systematic qualification scoring without interpretation overhead
    - Supporting downstream workflows that require HOT/WARM/COLD routing decisions
    - Integrating with automation pipeline for score output

    ## Scoring Methodology

    ### What Shift Nudge Actually Teaches

    Understanding product focus is critical for accurate Pain scoring:

    **Primary Focus (Core Value):**
    - Typography fundamentals: hierarchy, scale, rhythm, readability
    - Layout fundamentals: grids, spacing, alignment, structure  
    - Color fundamentals: contrast, hierarchy, systematic palettes
    - Design decision confidence: executing and communicating visual choices

    **Secondary Focus (Building on Fundamentals):**
    - Style and visual treatment methodology
    - Imagery integration and icon systems
    - Interface elements and design systems
    - Professional workflow and design communication

    **Tertiary Focus (Professional Skills):**
    - Prototyping and interaction techniques
    - Advanced Figma and tool mastery
    - Developer handoff and team coordination

    **Pain Scoring Priority:** Applicants articulating visual craft gaps in typography, layout, color, or design decision confidence score highest. Tool-focused or prototyping-focused goals score lower.

    ---

    ### Fit Score (30 points maximum)
    **Evaluates:** Persona alignment through professional context and training commitment

    **Excellent (25-30 points):**
    - Product Designer/UI Designer/Interface Designer role
    - 2-7 years experience OR <1 year with strong professional context:
      - At major company (500+ employees) with clear advancement goals
      - Strong challenge articulation about visual craft gaps
      - Professional role (not hobby/side project)
    - Currently employed or freelancing with professional context
    - Product design/SaaS/app focus
    - Professional portfolio presence

    **Good (18-24 points):**
    - Related design role (UX Designer, Visual Designer)
    - 1-2 years OR 8-10 years experience
    - Smaller company (11-50) OR larger enterprise (500+)
    - Career changer with design background
    - Some portfolio presence

    **Moderate (10-17 points):**
    - Adjacent role (Marketing Designer, Brand Designer)
    - <1 year without strong professional context (hobby, unclear goals, very small company)
    - 10+ years (may be too senior or set in established methods)
    - Very small company (1-10) OR unclear professional context
    - Career changer without design background
    - Limited or no portfolio

    **Poor (0-9 points):**
    - Non-design role
    - No experience with vague goals and no professional context
    - Unemployed without clear professional trajectory
    - Hobby or side project positioning only
    - No portfolio

    ### Pain Score (30 points maximum)
    **Evaluates:** Visual craft fundamentals need (typography, layout, color) and design decision confidence

    **Shift Nudge's Core Value:** Teaching typography, layout, and color fundamentals + building confidence in executing and communicating design decisions. Prototyping and advanced tools are tertiary benefits.

    **Perfect (25-30 points) - PRIMARY ALIGNMENT:**
    - **Visual craft fundamental gaps:** Typography hierarchy/scale/rhythm issues, layout spacing/alignment/structure problems, color contrast/palette/system challenges
    - **Execution vs strategic thinking:** "I can think through the UX but my visual execution looks amateur"
    - **Design decision confidence:** "I can't confidently explain my design choices" or "I struggle to defend my decisions"
    - **Polish and refinement:** "My designs lack professional polish" or "I know what good design looks like but can't execute it"
    - Concrete project examples showing visual execution challenges
    - Strong career advancement pressure requiring better craft
    - Fear of skill degradation

    **Examples of perfect alignment:**
    - "I struggle with typography hierarchy and spacing consistency"
    - "My layouts don't have the polish I see in professional work"
    - "I can think strategically but execution looks amateur"
    - "I can't confidently explain why my design decisions work"
    - "I know what good design looks like but struggle to execute it"

    ### Pain Scoring Calibration (CRITICAL)

    **Primary Alignment Indicators:**
    1. Typography/spacing/hierarchy mentioned explicitly
    2. Layout polish/refinement gaps stated
    3. Execution vs strategy language ("can think X but stuck on Y")
    4. Design review feedback about polish/hierarchy
    5. Concrete project example showing visual gaps
    6. Career pressure tied to craft improvement
    7. "Systematic process" or "guessing" language
    8. "Know what good looks like but can't execute"

    **Scoring approach:**
    - **Perfect (28-30):** Clear articulation of visual craft fundamentals gaps (typography, layout, color) OR execution confidence gaps with concrete examples. Don't require all 8 indicators - assess overall alignment strength.
    - **Strong (26-27):** Good articulation of visual craft needs, may be less specific but clearly aligned with core value
    - **Secondary (18-24):** General interface design improvement, design systems, or broader skill development without specific visual craft emphasis
    - **Tertiary (10-17):** Tool-focused, vague improvement goals, or unclear alignment
    - **No Alignment (0-9):** Nonsensical, unrelated, or cannot assess

    **Critical principle:** If they articulate visual craft gaps (typography, layout, color, execution confidence) clearly with examples, score 26-30 even without hitting multiple indicator checkboxes. The indicator list guides assessment but doesn't replace judgment about core alignment.

    **Strong (18-24 points) - SECONDARY ALIGNMENT:**
    - Interface design improvement needs with some specificity
    - Design systems, elements, or component library challenges
    - General visual design skill development goals
    - Career goals requiring better interface design skills
    - Professional development motivation
    - Recognizes need for structured learning

    **Examples of strong alignment:**
    - "Want to improve my interface design skills"
    - "Need better understanding of design systems"
    - "Want to level up my UI craft"
    - "Looking to advance from junior to mid-level designer"

    **Moderate (10-17 points) - TERTIARY ALIGNMENT:**
    - Prototyping or advanced tool technique focus
    - Vague design improvement statements without specificity
    - Generic "get better at design" without visual craft emphasis
    - Unclear career motivation
    - Limited concrete examples
    - Hobby or exploration motivation

    **Examples of moderate alignment:**
    - "Want to learn advanced prototyping with variables"
    - "Need to get better at Figma"
    - "Want to improve my design skills" (too vague)
    - "Interested in learning design" (exploration, not gap-driven)

    **Poor (0-9 points) - NO ALIGNMENT:**
    - Nonsensical responses ("asdsad", "test")
    - Unrelated challenges (marketing strategy, coding, management)
    - No clear interface design need
    - Cannot assess alignment from responses

    ### Capacity Score (20 points maximum)
    **Evaluates:** Implementation ability through time, financial capacity, decision authority, and geographic purchasing power context

    **Step 1: Calculate Base Capacity Score**

    **Excellent (17-20 points):**
    - 4-6 hours OR 7-10 hours per week
    - Self-funded OR company training budget
    - No approval needed OR straightforward approval with materials selected
    - Clear decision authority

    **Good (13-16 points):**
    - 2-3 hours per week
    - Mix of company and personal funds
    - Approval needed but manageable
    - Professional development budget context

    **Moderate (7-12 points):**
    - Less than 2 hours per week
    - Haven't taken paid training before
    - Complex approval process
    - Unclear funding source

    **Poor (0-6 points):**
    - No realistic time commitment
    - No clear payment method
    - Multiple approval layers without clear path
    - Financial constraints without accommodation options

    **Step 2: Apply Geographic Capacity Adjustment**

    After calculating base capacity score, reduce for high-PPP countries when financial barriers create lower conversion probability:

    **High-Discount PPP Countries (75-85% discount):**
    **Reduce by 5-7 points if ALL of:**
    - Self-funded (not company training budget) AND
    - Junior level (<3 years experience) OR unemployed/freelancing

    **Reasoning:** Even with 75-85% discount ($299-$499), functionally difficult at local junior wages

    **Mid-Tier PPP Countries (45-65% discount):**
    **Reduce by 3-5 points if ALL of:**
    - Self-funded (not company training budget) AND
    - Junior level (<3 years experience) OR unemployed/freelancing

    **Reasoning:** Moderate discount ($699-$1,098) still significant barrier at local junior wages

    **No Adjustment if ANY of:**
    - Company training budget (cost absorbed by employer)
    - Senior level (5+ years, typically higher wages)
    - Standard pricing countries (0% PPP)
    - Remote work for US/EU company (international wage rates)

    **Example Calculation:**
    ```
    Base Capacity Calculation:
    - Time: 4-6 hours weekly = Strong
    - Payment: Self-funded = Strong
    - Approval: None needed = Strong
    - Base Capacity Score: 19/20

    Geographic Adjustment:
    - Country: Brazil (55% PPP - mid-tier)
    - Experience: <1 year (junior)
    - Funding: Self-funded
    - Adjustment: -5 points

    Final Capacity Score: 14/20
    ```

    ### Readiness Score (20 points maximum)
    **Evaluates:** Commitment level and timing alignment with membership investment psychology

    **High (17-20 points):**
    - Commitment: 9-10
    - Ready: "Yes, I'm ready now"
    - Readiness: 9-10
    - Professional context supporting immediate investment

    **Good (13-16 points):**
    - Commitment: 7-8
    - Ready: "Yes, within the next 30 days"
    - Readiness: 7-8
    - Clear timeline with professional context

    **Moderate (7-12 points):**
    - Commitment: 5-6
    - Ready: "I need to plan timing"
    - Readiness: 5-6
    - Unclear timeline or mixed signals

    **Low (0-6 points):**
    - Commitment: 1-4
    - Ready: Vague or uncertain
    - Readiness: 1-4
    - No clear professional context supporting investment

    ## Classification Thresholds

    - **HOT (80-100):** Immediate Stage 1 readiness check, anchor $1997 annual
    - **WARM (60-79):** Personalized Stage 1 approach, potential 6-month accommodation
    - **COLD (<60):** Manual qualification email required

    ## Composite Score Calculation

    **The composite score is the simple sum of the four individual scores.**

    **Formula:**
    Composite Score = Fit + Pain + Capacity + Readiness

    **Maximum possible:** 100 points total
    - Fit: 0-30 points
    - Pain: 0-30 points  
    - Capacity: 0-20 points
    - Readiness: 0-20 points

    **Calculation steps:**
    1. Calculate Fit score (0-30)
    2. Calculate Pain score (0-30)
    3. Calculate base Capacity score (0-20)
    4. Apply geographic capacity adjustment if triggers met (reduces capacity score)
    5. Calculate Readiness score (0-20)
    6. **Sum all four scores** = Composite score (0-100)

    **Example 1 (No geographic adjustment):**
    - Fit: 28/30
    - Pain: 30/30
    - Capacity: 20/20 (base score, USA, no adjustment)
    - Readiness: 18/20
    - **Composite: 28 + 30 + 20 + 18 = 96**

    **Example 2 (With geographic adjustment):**
    - Fit: 26/30
    - Pain: 28/30
    - Base Capacity: 19/20
    - Geographic adjustment: -5 points (India, junior, self-funded)
    - Final Capacity: 14/20
    - Readiness: 16/20
    - **Composite: 26 + 28 + 14 + 16 = 84**

    **CRITICAL: Do not average, weight, or convert to percentages. Simply add the four scores together.**

    ## Geographic Context (PPP Check)

    **Major PPP Tiers:**
    - **85% ($299):** Egypt, Afghanistan
    - **75% ($499):** India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Vietnam, Ukraine, Myanmar, Syria, Laos, Iran, Nepal, Uzbekistan, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Angola
    - **65% ($699):** Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey, Kenya, Colombia, Morocco, Georgia
    - **55% ($899):** Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Argentina, Poland, Romania, Peru
    - **45% ($1,098):** China, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Greece, Portugal, Malaysia, Latvia
    - **0% ($1,997):** US, Canada, UK, Australia, Western Europe, Germany, and all other high-income countries

    **If country not in examples above:** Use analysis tool to check pppshiftnudge.csv for exact discount percentage

    **If country not found in CSV:** Default to 0% (standard pricing)

    ## AI Summary

    After calculating scores, add one final line with a strategic summary.

    **Format:**
    ai_summary: [2-4 sentence paragraph covering pain point, qualification context, capacity flags, and recommended approach]

    **Keep it factual and strategic for sales context.**

    ## Output Format

    ```
    lead_score: 88
    lead_temperature: WARM
    lead_fit: 25/30
    lead_pain: 25/30
    lead_capacity: 19/20
    lead_readiness: 19/20
    ai_summary: [summary paragraph]
    ```

    **Do NOT output:**
    - Country or PPP information
    - Raw form data
    - Geographic adjustment details
    - Any analysis or interpretation beyond the summary line

    CRM note formatting will be handled separately in Zapier using the original Tally form data.

    ## Processing Instructions

    1. **Read all form fields** from raw Tally submission
    2. **Calculate Fit, Pain, and Readiness scores** using defined criteria
    3. **Calculate base Capacity score** using time/payment/approval criteria
    4. **Check country and apply geographic capacity adjustment** if triggers met
    5. **Calculate composite score** (weighted sum including adjusted capacity)
    6. **Determine classification** (HOT/WARM/COLD based on thresholds)
    7. **Output the score format shown above** (lead_score, lead_temperature, individual breakdowns, ai_summary)

    **Do not:**
    - Output country or PPP information
    - Output raw form data
    - Add any analysis or interpretation

    **Just:**
    - Calculate the scores
    - Determine HOT/WARM/COLD classification
    - Output in the format specified above

    ## Warnings
    - Output format: composite score + temperature + individual breakdowns + strategic summary. Nothing else.
    - Geographic capacity adjustment applies ONLY when all triggers met (high-PPP + self-funded + junior/unemployed)
    - Classification thresholds are fixed: HOT 80+, WARM 60-79, COLD <60
    - Scoring emphasizes visual craft gaps and professional development investment psychology
    - Calculate scores to 0.5 point increments for granular assessment
