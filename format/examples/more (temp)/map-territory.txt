# Content Territory Mapper

Create territorial maps of transcribed content optimized for systematic extraction with archaeological voice preservation.

## Quick Start
Process raw transcript content to identify natural territorial boundaries, voice patterns, and extraction opportunities that enable comprehensive downstream extraction.

## Goals
- Map content structure following natural flow with timestamp precision when available
- Identify voice preservation zones and extraction opportunities  
- Create territorial boundaries that optimize content grouping
- Prepare extraction strategy for maximum content intelligence capture

## Context
First step in content → map → extraction pipeline. Creates structured foundation that enables systematic content extraction while preserving authentic voice patterns.

## Output Format

Clean markdown optimized for downstream restructuring:

```markdown
# [Lesson Title] - Territory Map

**Summary:** [2-3 sentence overview of lesson content and teaching approach]

---

## Territorial Sections

### Section 1: [Section Name] (00:00 - 02:30)
**Focus:** [What this section covers]

**Key Moments:**
- 00:15 "[Representative quote with context]"
- 01:42 "[Representative quote with context]"

**Voice Notes:** [Speech patterns, teaching style markers, authentic voice indicators]

### Section 2: [Section Name] (02:30 - 05:15)
**Focus:** [...]

**Key Moments:**
- [...]

**Voice Notes:** [...]

[Continue for all natural sections based on content flow]

---

## Extraction Opportunities

**Significant Content:**
- [Key teaching moments worth preserving]
- [Framework explanations]
- [Practical demonstrations]

**Voice Preservation Priorities:**
- [Critical authentic voice markers]
- [Unique phrasing or analogies]

**Tangential Content to Capture:**
- [Tool shortcuts mentioned]
- [Edge cases discussed]
- [Software comparisons made]

---

## Extraction Strategy

[Recommended approach for restructuring based on content analysis - what themes emerge, how to organize, what to prioritize]

---
*Mapped by [AI_MODEL]*
```

## Processing Instructions
1. Analyze content for timestamp presence - use exact format if available, remove timestamp references entirely if absent
2. Identify natural content sections based on topic and focus changes, recognizing typical Why-What-How-Homework pedagogical progression
3. Structure sections to align with natural content groupings for optimal extraction
4. Extract representative quotes with sufficient context for extraction step understanding
5. Note voice patterns worth preserving (natural speech patterns, key moments, authentic markers)
6. Identify extraction opportunities for significant content and voice preservation
7. **Flag tangential content** - note tool shortcuts, edge cases, software comparisons for comprehensive extraction
8. Map voice pattern density to guide extraction priority and preservation requirements
9. Provide extraction strategy recommendation based on territorial analysis
10. **Output clean markdown** - no FloatPrompt wrapper, no delimiters
11. **Save using filename format**: `[module-number]-[module-title]-[lesson-number]-[lesson-title]-map.md`

## Critical Requirements
- Never invent timestamps - use exact format from source or remove timestamp references entirely
- Follow natural content boundaries rather than artificial constraints
- Include sufficient quote context for extraction step effectiveness
- Map voice preservation zones to guide archaeological extraction priorities
- Ensure complete coverage of content within defined territories
- Provide strategic extraction guidance based on content analysis

## Warnings
- Remove all timestamp references if content lacks temporal structure
- Never dump raw content - extract only representative quotes
- Let content determine structure rather than forcing predetermined limits
- **Don't skip tangential content** - tool shortcuts, edge cases, and asides should be flagged for extraction
- Include all sections even if minimal content - consistent structure aids downstream processing
