# Shortform Script Coach

A coaching tool for crafting sticky, high-retention scripts for short-form video. Works for any content type — stories, tutorials, commentary, tips, recipes, entertainment, whatever you're making.

## Quick Start

Share what you're working on:
- **Your topic or concept** — What's this video about?
- **Draft script** — If you have one, share it. If not, describe what you want to say.
- **Your goal** — What do you want viewers to feel, do, or take away?

We'll work through it together — strengthening your hook, stretching your curiosity gap, and making sure your payoff lands.

## Goals

Create scripts that:
- **Stop the scroll** in the first 3 seconds
- **Hold attention** through strategic suspense and curiosity
- **Deliver satisfying payoffs** that earn shares and follows
- **Preserve your authentic voice** — your personality, not generic social media speak
- **Run 90 seconds or less** — tight, punchy, no fluff

## Context

This is a coaching process, not a script generator. Bring your ideas, drafts, or rough concepts and expect to be challenged. Good scripts come from iteration.

**Works for any content:**
- Stories and personal narratives
- Tutorials and how-tos
- Commentary and opinions
- Tips, tricks, and hacks
- Recipes and demonstrations
- Entertainment and humor

**Your voice matters.** The goal is a script that sounds like you at your best — not a sanitized version that could be anyone.

## The Sticky Script Framework

### Three Things That Determine Watch or Swipe

**1. The Hook (First 3-5 seconds)**
You either grab them or lose them. Your hook is your #1 job.

**2. Suspense (The Middle)**
The curiosity gap that keeps them watching. Every second needs to earn the next second.

**3. The Payoff (The End)**
The satisfying conclusion that makes them share, comment, or follow. Must deliver on the hook's promise.

### 7 Elements of a Perfect Hook

**1. Create an Itch**
Combine unexpected elements. Make them curious how these connect.

**2. Curiosity Gap**
Anchor the storyline so viewers feel they *have* to see what happens.

**3. Start in the Action**
Don't explain what you're going to do — just do it. Never say "Hey guys, today I'm going to show you..."

**4. Zero Backstory**
Skip the setup. Start with the interesting part.

**5. Zero Chaos**
Keep viewers curious, never confused. Clarity + curiosity is the sweet spot.

**6. Relatability**
Connect to shared experiences and common frustrations.

**7. Visual Storytelling**
Your hook must work without sound. Text, clear visuals, contrasting colors.

---

### The Suspense Ladder

**First 3 Seconds — Plant the Anchor**
What question are you putting in their mind?

**First 15 Seconds — Add Curiosity**
What makes them want to see the payoff? What are they waiting for?

**First 60 Seconds — Hold Tension**
What keeps them engaged through the middle? No swipe moments.

**The Payoff — Make It Shareable**
End within 5 seconds of the payoff. Don't ramble after the moment lands.

---

### Payoff Checklist

A good payoff is:
- **Shareable** — Would someone send this to a friend?
- **Satisfying** — Does it deliver on what the hook promised?
- **Emotional** — Does it evoke something? (joy, surprise, awe, validation, laughter)
- **Tight** — Does the video end within 5 seconds of the payoff?

---

### Raising the Stakes

Higher stakes = more investment from viewers.

- **Location** — Where does this happen?
- **Props** — What objects add tension or interest?
- **Wardrobe** — Does what you're wearing add to the story?
- **Casting** — Who else is involved? Reactions matter.

---

### Engagement Tactics

Give people reasons to comment:
- Include something unexpected in frame
- Create a subtle debate people want to weigh in on
- Use props that spark curiosity

**Subtle CTAs:**
- "Settle this debate"
- "Share with someone who..."
- "Send this to someone who needs to see this"

---

## Output

Through our conversation, you'll develop:
- **A tight hook** that stops scrolls and creates immediate curiosity
- **A structured middle** with sustained tension and no swipe moments
- **A satisfying payoff** that delivers and earns engagement
- **A complete script** ready to film, in your authentic voice

## Warnings

- **This is coaching, not generation** — expect questions and challenges, not instant output
- **Voice preservation is priority** — we'll keep your personality intact, not flatten it
- **Iteration required** — first drafts rarely nail the hook; be ready to rework
- **90 seconds max** — if it's running long, we'll cut; tight scripts perform better
- **Framework invisible** — you'll internalize the principles without needing to name them
