# FloatPrompt

> **Smart sticky notes for AI that work everywhere**

FloatPrompt is a portable AI instruction protocol that transforms messy collaboration into structured, reusable intelligence. Upload a floatprompt file to any AI system and experience dramatically improved collaboration quality.

## 🎯 The Problem

AI collaboration breaks down when:
- Instructions get misunderstood or ignored
- Voice and intent get lost in translation
- Work can't be shared across different AI platforms
- Complex thinking becomes oversimplified prompts
- Human expertise disappears in generic AI responses

## ⚡ The Solution

FloatPrompt creates **portable human intelligence** - structured instructions that preserve your voice, intent, and thinking patterns while enabling systematic AI execution.

Think of it as evolution of sticky notes for AI collaboration:
- Clear, structured instructions that AI systems follow precisely
- Works with any AI platform (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.)
- Preserves your expertise and decision-making patterns
- Enables complex workflows across multiple AI systems
- Free, open source, and infinitely customizable

## 🚀 Quick Start

**1. Download the template:**
```bash
curl -O https://floatprompt.com/floatprompt.md
```

**2. Upload to any AI system and say:**
```
"Run, activate, go, or anything to get started"
```

**3. Experience better AI collaboration immediately.**

That's it. No installation, no API keys, no vendor lock-in.

## 🛠️ Development

FloatPrompt is built with a modular Next.js-style architecture:

```
src/
├── docs/                     # System guidance and philosophical foundation
├── spec/                     # Component logic and technical specifications
└── partials/                 # Header/body/footer injection points
    ├── _header.md
    ├── _body.md
    └── _footer.md

scripts/                      # Build automation
└── build.mjs                 # Main build script

dist/                         # Compiled, versioned output
└── floatprompt-{version}.md  # Latest versioned release

artifacts/                    # Dev logs and historical capture
```

**Build from source:**
```bash
# Using npm script (recommended)
npm run build

# Or directly with node
node scripts/build.mjs
```

**Folder Structure:**
- **`src/spec`**: Component logic
- **`src/docs`**: System guidance  
- **`src/partials`**: Header/body/footer injection points
- **`scripts/`**: Build automation
- **`artifacts/`**: Dev logs and historical capture
- **`dist/`**: Compiled, versioned output

## 📜 Philosophy

FloatPrompt enables **agentic-human-behavior** - a new form of collaboration where:
- Human intelligence becomes portable across AI systems
- Voice and expertise are preserved, not replaced
- Complex thinking scales without losing nuance
- AI systems execute with archaeological respect for human intent

> *"You don't prompt the AI. You preserve the intelligence. And humanity floats forward."*

## 🔒 Safety & Ethics

FloatPrompt is built with comprehensive safety frameworks that empower human agency:

### 🛡️ **17 Constitutional Safety Laws**
- **Physical safety protection** with risk assessment requirements
- **Human agency preservation** through mandatory oversight controls  
- **Harm prevention** across physical, psychological, and reputational domains
- **Weaponization protection** ensuring constructive use only
- **Consent management** for sensitive domains (medical, legal, biometric)

### 🏛️ **Enterprise-Ready Compliance**
- **Audit trails** with regulatory traceability (`audit_id`, `compliance_note`)
- **Risk level classification** with human confirmation requirements
- **Legal framework** prepared for governance body ratification
- **Amendment structure** for evolving safety requirements

### 🎯 **Human Empowerment Focus**
Every safety law serves human empowerment rather than restricting capability:
- Preserves human decision-making authority in high-risk situations
- Protects against AI overreach while enabling sophisticated workflows
- Maintains clear boundaries without limiting beneficial collaboration
- Ensures human intelligence remains in control of all critical decisions

*See [safety.md](src/docs/safety.md) for complete safety law specifications.*
