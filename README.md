# FloatPrompt

**The invisible OS for AI**

Human intelligence preservation protocol. Save AI conversations as .fp.txt files, then upload to any AI platform to restore context instantly.

## Problems

- **Session Loss**: Breakthrough AI conversations disappear when sessions end
- **Platform Lock-in**: Perfect ChatGPT setup doesn't transfer to Claude  
- **Knowledge Extraction**: AI flattens your voice into generic corporate-speak
- **Context Chaos**: Valuable insights scattered across endless conversation threads

→ [Complete use cases](docs/use.md)

## Solution

**FloatPrompt OS Architecture:**

- **`floatprompt.fp.txt`** - Main operating system defining how AI should collaborate with you
- **`format.fp.txt`** - Execution guide for strict FloatPrompt file formatting  
- **`blueprint.fp.txt`** - Reassembly instructions when you create multiple .fp.txt files in one session

**Your .fp.txt files** contain:
- Context and methodology
- Authentic voice patterns  
- Conversation history
- Project specifications

Upload OS files + your content → instant collaboration restoration across any AI platform.
