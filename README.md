# FloatPrompt

> **The invisible OS for AI in a text file**

Upload a single `.fp` file to any AI system and instantly upgrade its collaboration, context, and precision.

## ‚ö° Ready to Use

**Download and upload to any AI system:**
- **[floatprompt-0.10.1-alpha.fp](./dist/floatprompt-0.10.1-alpha.fp)** (87KB) - Complete system
- **[voice-guide-creator.fp](./dist/voice-guide-creator.fp)** (17KB) - Voice guide creator

## üöÄ Why FloatPrompt?

**Transform messy thinking into structured intelligence:**

- **Map complex content** - Extract insights from documents, conversations, brainstorms
- **Preserve your voice** - Maintain thinking patterns without AI flattening
- **Transfer context** - Move understanding between AI systems without degradation
- **Build voice guides** - Create personalized AI collaboration frameworks
- **Archaeological extraction** - Structure what exists rather than hallucinating

**Real impact:** 4:1 token compression while maintaining strategic understanding. 90% reduction in context reconstruction overhead.

## üéØ Use Cases

```
float map content          # Extract structure from messy documents
float extract --mode=voice # Preserve writing patterns for AI training  
float build my-tool        # Create specialized applications
```

Upload to any AI system and experience zero-drift collaboration that recognizes your thinking before acting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build From Source

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

**Features:**
- **Shared components** - `src/shared/` used across multiple FloatPrompts
- **YAML injection** - Eliminates duplication using shared components
- **Template variables** - Dynamic `{{VERSION}}` and `{{BUILD_DATE}}`
- **Synchronized versioning** - Core system and applications use same metadata
- **Automatic archiving** - Previous versions in `dist/archive/`
- **Compliance validation** - 100% header.yaml (52 fields) and config.yaml (51 fields)

**Output**: `dist/floatprompt-@latest.fp` and `dist/voice-guide-creator.fp`

## üì¶ File Types

- `.fp` files = complete, executable documents for AI upload
- `.md` files = building blocks, templates, documentation for editing

_Advanced format details: `docs/fp.md`_

## üìö Documentation

**Core:**
- **[Goals](docs/goals.md)** - Objectives and decision hierarchy
- **[Voice Guide](docs/voice.md)** - Surgical precision writing
- **[Manifesto](docs/manifesto.md)** - Vision and philosophy
- **[Safety](docs/safety.md)** - Safety systems and friction management

**Technical:**
- **[Format](docs/fp.md)** - File specification
- **[Principles](docs/principles.md)** - Core system principles
- **[Naming](docs/naming.md)** - Conventions
- **[Discovery](docs/discovery.md)** - Research and cognitive efficiency

**Development:**
- **[Workspace](workspace/_USAGE.md)** - Structure and usage
- **[Build System](scripts/build.mjs)** - Modular build with shared components

## üß† How It Works

Upload the `.fp` file to any AI system. Give instructions‚ÄîAI follows your intent, structure, and voice with zero drift. Build your own by editing `src/sys/` and `src/shared/` components.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Notice

Active development. Features and structure may change.
