# FloatPrompt
> Start where you left off

**Your AI collaboration, preserved and portable across any platform.**

Stop re-explaining context. Stop losing good work. Start building.

## The Problem

AI conversations disappear and with them, the work, insights, and tools that emerged from them.

- **Session Loss**: Breakthrough AI collaboration vanishes when sessions end
- **Platform Lock-in**: Perfect ChatGPT workflows don't transfer to Claude  
- **Voice Flattening**: AI rewrites your intelligence into generic patterns
- **Context Chaos**: Valuable work scattered across endless conversation threads

## The Solution

```
<fp> Wrapper
Structure, portability, and consistency. Provides a standard format that AI systems can recognize and process consistently across different platforms. Creates clear boundaries for floatprompt content.

<json> Section
AI behavioral context and systematic instructions. Gives AI explicit rules about how to behave, what to preserve, when to ask questions, and how to handle different trigger commands. More precise than natural language instructions.

<md> Section
Human readability and structured AI guidance. Uses markdown hierarchy (headings, sections) to organize information that both humans can easily read/modify and AI can systematically process. Explains what the tool does, when to use it, and what to expect.

Together:
A dual-native format. Humans can read and understand it, AI gets systematic behavioral instructions, and it works the same way across different AI platforms. The wrapper ensures recognition, JSON provides AI precision, markdown enables human comprehension and AI guidance.

- **Cross-platform continuity** - Same collaboration sophistication, any AI platform
- **Voice preservation** - Your authentic communication style, maintained
- **Progressive building** - Conversations that become tools, workflows, and systematic intelligence
- **Context preservation** - Never lose good AI work again

**Core System:**
- **`floatprompt.txt`** (2KB) - Universal template for creating portable AI tools
- **`floatprompt-os.txt`** (36KB) - Complete operating system with Map → Decide → Structure methodology

**Specialized Tools:**
- **`lib/blueprint.txt`** - Assembly specification and reconstruction (16KB)
- **`lib/format.txt`** - Technical formatting and document creation (14KB)  
- **`lib/voice.txt`** - Voice preservation and pattern extraction (12KB)

**Your floatprompt files** enable:
- Continue AI collaboration across platforms without losing progress
- Build on previous work instead of starting from scratch
- Advance your AI workflow sophistication systematically
- Preserve the tools and intelligence that emerge from conversations

## Quick Start

**1: Start simple**
Download [`floatprompt.txt`](dist/floatprompt.txt) - Universal template for creating your first portable AI tool

**2: Go full hard-core voice preservation mode**  
Download [`floatprompt-os.txt`](dist/floatprompt-os.txt) - Complete OS with strong voice preservation protocols, embedded methodology, and tool creation features

**3. Work with specialized tools or create your own**
Browse [`lib/`](dist/lib/) - Voice guide creation, formatting, and assembly tools


## How It Works

1. **Upload** a floatprompt file to any AI platform
2. **Have a conversation** about your specific need or project
3. **Create a structured floatprompt** of your valuable session
4. **Save it for future sessions** on any platform

### **Progression Over Repetition**
- **Continue building** rather than starting over
- **Advance sophistication** rather than repeat explanations
- **Preserve progress** rather than lose context
- **Enable growth** rather than platform lock-in

### **Your Intelligence, Preserved**
- **Archaeological precision** - Exact voice patterns and thinking processes maintained
- **Zero interpretation** - Your intelligence, not AI's interpretation of it
- **Cross-platform reliability** - Same results on ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, any AI
- **Emergent continuity** - Tools and workflows that develop through conversation, preserved
