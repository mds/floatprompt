# FloatPrompt

> **The invisible AI operating system in a text file**

FloatPrompt is a portable AI instruction protocol that transforms any AI system into a strategic consultant. Upload one markdown file and experience dramatically improved collaboration quality across all platforms.

*Think of it as really smart sticky notes for AI that work everywhere.*

## 🎯 The Problem

AI collaboration breaks down when:
- Instructions get misunderstood or ignored
- Voice and intent get lost in translation
- Work can't be shared across different AI platforms
- Complex thinking becomes oversimplified prompts
- Human expertise disappears in generic AI responses

## ⚡ The Solution

FloatPrompt is a set of structured instructions that preserve your voice, intent, and thinking patterns while enabling systematic AI execution. It allows you to create portable human intelligence in the form of new floatprompts generated from the floatprompt structure. 

You can use them as your own readable markdown documents, but they also contain high-context awareness for AI models, so you can feed them back into any AI model and have it instantly pick up context. FloatPrompts are portable, traceable, scalable, repeatable, and infinitely reusable intelligence.

Like an OS upgrade for AI collaboration:
- **Single file installation** that transforms AI behavior across platforms
- **Universal compatibility** with Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and future systems
- **Voice preservation** maintains your expertise and decision-making patterns
- **Complex workflows** coordinated across multiple AI systems seamlessly
- **Open architecture** - free, transparent, and infinitely customizable

## 🚀 Quick Start

**1. Download the template:**
```bash
curl -O https://floatprompt.com/floatprompt.md
```

**2. Upload to any AI system and say:**
```
"Run, activate, go, or anything to get started"
```

**3. Experience better AI collaboration immediately.**

That's it. No installation, no API keys, no vendor lock-in.

## 📜 Philosophy

FloatPrompt enables **agentic-human-behavior** - an invisible operating system where:
- Human intelligence becomes portable across any AI platform
- Voice and expertise are preserved, not replaced
- Complex thinking scales without losing nuance
- AI systems execute with archaeological respect for human intent
- One text file transforms how AI behaves, everywhere


## 🔒 Safety & Ethics

FloatPrompt is built with safety frameworks that empower human agency:

### 🛡️ **Constitutional Safety Laws**
- **Physical safety protection** with risk assessment requirements
- **Human agency preservation** through mandatory oversight controls  
- **Harm prevention** across physical, psychological, and reputational domains
- **Weaponization protection** ensuring constructive use only
- **Consent management** for sensitive domains (medical, legal, biometric)

### 🏛️ **Enterprise-Ready Compliance**
- **Audit trails** with regulatory traceability (`audit_id`, `compliance_note`)
- **Risk level classification** with human confirmation requirements
- **Legal framework** prepared for governance body ratification
- **Amendment structure** for evolving safety requirements

### 🎯 **Human Empowerment Focus**
Every safety law serves human empowerment rather than restricting capability:
- Preserves human decision-making authority in high-risk situations
- Protects against AI overreach while enabling sophisticated workflows
- Maintains clear boundaries without limiting beneficial collaboration
- Ensures human intelligence remains in control of all critical decisions

*See [safety.md](src/docs/safety.md) for complete safety law specifications.*
