# FloatPrompt
> Start where you left off

**Your AI collaboration, preserved and portable across any platform.**

Stop re-explaining context. Stop losing good work. Start building.

## The Problem

AI conversations disappear and with them, the work, insights, and tools that emerged from them.

- **Session Loss**: Breakthrough AI collaboration vanishes when sessions end
- **Platform Lock-in**: Perfect ChatGPT workflows don't transfer to Claude  
- **Voice Flattening**: AI rewrites your intelligence into generic patterns
- **Context Chaos**: Valuable work scattered across endless conversation threads

## The Solution

```
<fp> Wrapper
Structure, portability, and consistency. Provides a standard format that AI systems can recognize and process consistently across different platforms. Creates clear boundaries for floatprompt content.

<json> Section
AI behavioral context and systematic instructions. Gives AI explicit rules about how to behave, what to preserve, when to ask questions, and how to handle different trigger commands. More precise than natural language instructions.

<md> Section
Human readability and structured AI guidance. Uses markdown hierarchy (headings, sections) to organize information that both humans can easily read/modify and AI can systematically process. Explains what the tool does, when to use it, and what to expect.

Together:
A dual-native format. Humans can read and understand it, AI gets systematic behavioral instructions, and it works the same way across different AI platforms. The wrapper ensures recognition, JSON provides AI precision, markdown enables human comprehension and AI guidance.

- **Cross-platform continuity** - Same collaboration sophistication, any AI platform
- **Voice preservation** - Your authentic communication style, maintained
- **Progressive building** - Conversations that become tools, workflows, and systematic intelligence
- **Context preservation** - Never lose good AI work again

**Core System:**
- **`floatprompt.txt`** (3KB) - Complete AI collaboration system with creation protocol, voice preservation, and natural language triggers

**Natural Language Activation:**
- **"float map"** - Immediate content territory assessment and floatprompt creation
- **"float extract"** - Voice preservation extraction with conversational requirements gathering  
- **"float build"** - Systematic tool creation through collaborative dialogue
- **"float [anything]"** - Custom floatprompt creation for any specific use case

**Your floatprompt files** enable:
- Continue AI collaboration across platforms without losing progress
- Build on previous work instead of starting from scratch
- Advance your AI workflow sophistication systematically
- Preserve the tools and intelligence that emerge from conversations

## Quick Start

**Upload and activate:**
Download [`floatprompt.txt`](floatprompt.txt) and upload to any AI system (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.)

**Natural language triggers:**
- Say **"float map"** with content → AI immediately creates mapping floatprompt
- Say **"float extract"** → AI creates extraction tool through conversation
- Say **"float build [anything]"** → AI creates custom floatprompt for your use case

**Result:** Custom floatprompt files that preserve your work, voice, and collaboration context across any AI platform.


## How It Works

1. **Upload** `floatprompt.txt` to any AI platform
2. **Say "float [anything]"** to trigger custom floatprompt creation
3. **Collaborate** through conversation to define your specific needs
4. **Receive** a structured floatprompt file tailored to your use case
5. **Reuse** across any AI platform with consistent behavior

### **Human+AI Collaboration Model**
- **Joint execution** through conversational collaboration with shared context
- **Strategic framework application** to your specific situation  
- **Collaborative assistant** approach vs. autonomous software execution
- **Voice preservation** protocols maintain your authentic thinking patterns

### **Your Intelligence, Preserved**
- **Archaeological precision** - Exact voice patterns and thinking processes maintained
- **Zero interpretation** - Your intelligence, not AI's interpretation of it
- **Cross-platform reliability** - Same results on ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, any AI
- **Self-referential system** - Template teaches AI how to create more floatprompts
