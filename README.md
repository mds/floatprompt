**The invisible OS for AI**

A human intelligence preservation protocol by [@mds](https://mds.is) | ¬© 2025 Studio MDS, LLC

## üéØ **What is FloatPrompt?**

FloatPrompt solves the fundamental frustration of AI collaboration: you finally get ChatGPT working perfectly, then lose all that progress when you start a new session or switch platforms.

Think **File ‚Üí Save As for AI interaction**. FloatPrompt creates portable .fp.txt files that preserve your context, voice, and methodology. Upload to any AI platform and instantly restore your collaboration without starting over.

### **Core Problems FloatPrompt Solves**

- **Session Loss**: Spend 2 hours getting AI perfect, then waste 30 minutes re-explaining everything next week
- **Platform Lock-in**: Perfect ChatGPT setup can't transfer to Claude without starting from scratch  
- **Voice Flattening**: AI turns your authentic thinking into generic corporate-speak
- **Context Chaos**: Valuable AI conversations scattered across platforms, impossible to find or reuse
- **Breakthrough Loss**: Finally achieve perfect AI collaboration but can't reliably recreate it

### **The Method**

Built on the **Map ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Structure** methodology:

- **Map**: Surface the full terrain of your intent and context
- **Decide**: Choose what matters most without losing nuance  
- **Structure**: Organize for systematic AI execution while preserving your voice

This creates portable intelligence that travels with your work across any AI system.

### **Current Status**

*Development build system operational*

## üöÄ **How It Works**

FloatPrompt transforms AI collaboration from fragile, platform-locked conversations into portable, reusable intelligence:

**Before FloatPrompt**: "I had this amazing conversation with ChatGPT last month but I can't find it, and now I need to explain everything again..."

**With FloatPrompt**: Upload your .fp.txt file ‚Üí AI instantly understands your project, voice, and methodology ‚Üí Continue exactly where you left off

### **Key Capabilities**

- **Cross-Platform Intelligence**: Perfect ChatGPT session transfers instantly to Claude, Anthropic, or any AI
- **Session Continuation**: Pick up exactly where you stopped, days or weeks later
- **Voice Preservation**: Maintain your authentic thinking style instead of generic AI-speak
- **Knowledge Management**: Package weeks of AI collaboration into clean, reusable files
- **Team Sharing**: Send your refined AI context to teammates for instant collaboration
- **Breakthrough Recreation**: Reliably reproduce your best AI interactions every time

### **Discovery Insights**

Early analysis shows FloatPrompt enables:
- Significant information compression while maintaining complete strategic understanding
- Dramatic reduction in context reconstruction overhead
- Persistent cognitive scaffolding that works across sessions and platforms

This isn't incremental improvement‚Äîit's portable intelligence collaboration.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety-First Design**

FloatPrompt preserves human agency in AI collaboration:

- **Human oversight** for important decisions
- **Voice preservation** protections against cognitive flattening
- **Quality control** to prevent polished-but-wrong outputs
- **Agency amplification** rather than replacement

Your intelligence stays authentically yours.

## üåä **Protocol Philosophy**

FloatPrompt functions as both a practical tool and portable protocol:

**As Practical Tool**: Upload a .fp.txt file ‚Üí activate enhanced AI collaboration with your preserved context and voice

**As Protocol**: Joint execution contract where you declare intent and voice while AI structures and organizes, creating verifiable collaborative thinking

This dual nature makes FloatPrompt universally compatible while keeping human thinking valuable.
