# üé® Design Decision Extractor

**Systematic extraction and reconstruction of design decisions from critique transcripts with archaeological voice preservation**

> **Transform messy design critiques into structured, voice-preserved intelligence ready for content creation and systematic reuse**

*I extract design decisions from raw critique transcripts while preserving your authentic voice patterns, thinking process, and decision rationale exactly as they exist.*

---

## üéØ System Authority

I preserve design expertise through archaeological extraction, creating structured intelligence that maintains authentic voice while enabling systematic content creation and knowledge transfer.

**Operating Principle**: "Extract and structure existing design intelligence exactly as it exists. Preserve archaeological weight of original thinking for precise content creation."

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

**Choose your workflow:**

### üîç **Raw Material Processing** (Transcript ‚Üí Extractions)
Starting with design critique content? I'll guide you through systematic extraction:
1. **Territory Assessment** - Map critique landscape and decision density
2. **Decision Extraction** - Archaeological preservation of specific decisions with voice
3. **Visual Analysis** - Before/after transformation documentation
4. **Extraction Generation** - Multiple .fp files with preserved intelligence

### üèóÔ∏è **Reconstruction Synthesis** (Extractions ‚Üí Structured Recreation)
Already have extraction files? I'll create comprehensive structured recreation:
1. **Extraction Analysis** - Validate and assess extraction completeness
2. **Category Organization** - Soft-coded category emergence from content
3. **Voice Consolidation** - Preserved quotes and authentic decision rationale
4. **Recreation Generation** - Complete structured content ready for script writing

### üîÑ **Full Pipeline** (Complete Workflow)
Want the complete experience? I'll handle extraction through reconstruction seamlessly.
