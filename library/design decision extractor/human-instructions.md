2. Upload it to your AI system (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
3. The system will automatically activate

### Step 2: Choose Your Workflow
The tool automatically detects what you need:

**üîç Starting with raw materials?** ‚Üí Raw Material Processing
**üèóÔ∏è Already have extractions?** ‚Üí Reconstruction Synthesis  
**üîÑ Want everything done at once?** ‚Üí Full Pipeline

## üìã Workflow Options

### Option A: Raw Material Processing (Most Common)

**What you need:**
- Design critique transcript (minimum 3,000 words recommended)
- Before/after images of your design work
- Context about the project

**What you get:**
- Territorial map of your content
- Voice-preserved decision extractions
- Visual transformation analysis
- Multiple specialized `.fp` files for reconstruction

**How to do it:**
1. Upload or paste your design critique transcript
2. Attach before/after screenshots or design files
3. The AI will assess your content and recommend an extraction strategy
4. Follow the guided process through territory mapping and extraction
5. Download the generated `.fp` files

### Option B: Reconstruction Synthesis

**What you need:**
- `.fp` extraction files from Option A
- Clear goal for your final content format

**What you get:**
- Organized, categorized design decisions
- Voice-preserved rationale and thinking process
- Content optimized for viral scripts or educational materials

**How to do it:**
1. Upload your `.fp` extraction files from previous sessions
2. The AI validates quality and archaeological integrity
3. Review the synthesis strategy and categories
4. Receive your structured recreation ready for content creation

### Option C: Full Pipeline (Single Session)

**What you need:**
- Same materials as Option A
- Time for a complete session

**What you get:**
- Everything from Options A and B in one session
- Complete workflow from raw critique to content-ready output

**How to do it:**
1. Tell the AI you want the "complete design extraction workflow"
2. Provide transcript and visual materials
3. The AI handles the entire process from mapping to reconstruction

## üìÅ What You Need to Prepare

### üìÑ File Format Flexibility

**All extraction and reconstruction files work equally well as:**
- `.fp` files (FloatPrompt format)
- `.md` files (Markdown format) 
- `.txt` files (Plain text format)

**Choose the format that works best for your workflow:**
- `.fp` for FloatPrompt system integration
- `.md` for standard markdown editors and tools
- `.txt` for universal compatibility and simple text workflows

### ‚úÖ Prepare These Materials for Best Results

**Your Design Critique Transcript:**
- **At least 3,000 words** - Shorter transcripts won't have enough content for comprehensive extraction
- **Include who's speaking** - Mark when you're talking vs. others (e.g., "Designer:", "Client:")
- **Don't clean it up** - Keep your natural speech with "um," pauses, and corrections
- **Include your thinking process** - The messy parts where you're figuring things out

**Your Visual Materials:**
- **Take exact screenshots** of the original design (before your changes)
- **Take exact screenshots** of the final design (after your changes)
- **Use high resolution** - The AI needs to see details clearly
- **Don't use mockups** - Only use actual screenshots from the real project
- **Include step-by-step images** if you have them showing the transformation

**If You Have Video/Audio:**
- **Provide VTT subtitle files** if available - These contain exact timestamps automatically
- **YouTube auto-generated captions** work well - Download as VTT format
- **Professional transcription services** often provide timestamped files
- **Don't manually write timestamps** - Only use exact times from files or if you have them already

**Project Context to Include:**
- What the project was about and who it was for
- What problems you were trying to solve
- Any constraints or requirements you had
- Timeline and process you followed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Won't Work Well

**Transcript Issues:**
- Heavily edited or "cleaned up" transcripts
- Marketing copy or sales presentations
- Pure theory without actual design decisions
- Transcripts under 1,000 words

**Visual Issues:**
- Blurry or low-quality screenshots
- Mockups instead of real screenshots
- Missing before or after images
- Images that don't clearly show the transformation

## üé≠ What You'll Get Back

### Your Voice Will Sound Like You

When you get your extracted design decisions, you'll recognize your own voice immediately:

- **Your natural way of explaining things** - The exact words and phrases you use
- **Your thinking out loud moments** - Including "um," pauses, and when you're figuring things out (marked with ~ in the output)
- **Your corrections and changes** - When you say something, then correct yourself
- **Your teaching style** - How you naturally break down complex ideas

### Your Decision Process Will Be Complete

You'll see how you actually make design decisions:

- **Your step-by-step thinking** - How you work through problems
- **What matters to you** - Your priorities and criteria for making choices
- **Options you considered** - Other directions you thought about but didn't choose
- **Why you chose what you chose** - Your actual reasoning, not AI interpretation

### It Will Still Sound Professional

Even though we keep all your natural speech patterns:

- **Your expertise comes through** - Your methods and frameworks are clearly preserved
- **Your knowledge is clear** - Industry insights and best practices are maintained
- **Ready for clients** - Suitable for sharing with stakeholders and team members
- **Ready for teaching** - Perfect for creating educational content

### What We Don't Do

We won't "fix" or "improve" your voice:
- Your words stay exactly as you said them, even if they seem unclear
- We don't make you sound more "polished" or formal
- We don't add fancy AI language or corporate speak
- We don't guess what you "meant to say" - we use your actual words

## üí° Pro Tips

### Getting the Best Results

**Preparation:**
- Record yourself giving natural, unscripted design critiques
- Include the messy thinking process, not just final decisions
- Show your work with plenty of visual documentation
- Explain your reasoning as if teaching someone

**During Extraction:**
- Trust the archaeological process - don't try to "clean up" your voice
- Let the AI preserve your authentic thinking patterns
- Review territory maps carefully before proceeding
- Ask for clarification if the strategy doesn't match your goals

**For Content Creation:**
- Use the structured recreation as a foundation, not a final script
- Leverage the identified hooks and animation sequences
- Preserve the authentic voice while adapting for your audience
- Build on the systematic principles for educational impact

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Don't edit your transcript before extraction
- Don't skip the territory mapping phase
- Don't try to force predetermined categories
- Don't remove the "messy" parts of your thinking process

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If Territory Assessment Seems Wrong
- Tell the AI exactly what you disagree with
- Provide more context about your goals
- Request a different extraction strategy
- Use "emergency bypass" only for urgent simple fixes

### If Voice Preservation Feels Off
- Point out specific examples of what doesn't sound like you
- Request re-extraction with higher voice fidelity
- Check that you're using unedited source material
- Verify the AI is using archaeological extraction, not summarization

### If Categories Don't Make Sense
- Remember categories emerge from your content, not preset lists
- Request re-organization based on your actual decision patterns
- Clarify your intended use case for the final content
- Ask for alternative category structures

### If Content Creation Hooks Aren't Right
- Specify your target audience and content goals
- Request focus on different types of viral moments
- Clarify whether you want educational vs. entertainment focus
- Ask for alternative hook identification

### If Timestamp or Quality Requirements Aren't Met
- **For missing timestamps**: Provide VTT files or professional transcription with timing
- **For unclear transcripts**: Provide higher quality source material with speaker attribution
- **For low-resolution visuals**: Upload clearer before/after screenshots
- **For interpretation concerns**: Point out specific examples where voice wasn't preserved exactly
