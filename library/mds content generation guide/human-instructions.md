- Ask for alternative routing if strategy doesn't match your goals
- Clarify voice preservation requirements if archaeological authenticity is critical

**For Content Creation:**
- Use routed documents systematically rather than trying to skip steps
- Maintain voice preservation protocols throughout production workflow

- Don't ignore voice preservation requirements for quick content creation
- Don't try to force predetermined content categories without router analysis
- Don't bypass quality assurance checkpoints for archaeological voice authenticity

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If Content Routing Seems Wrong
- Tell the router exactly what you disagree with about document selection
- Provide more context about your content goals and audience requirements
- Request alternative routing strategy with different document combinations
- Use "emergency bypass" only for urgent simple content creation needs

### If Voice Preservation Requirements Aren't Clear
- Specify your archaeological authenticity priority level (high/medium/low)
- Request explanation of voice preservation protocols for your content type
- Clarify integration requirements between content creation and voice guides
- Ask for voice consistency validation criteria specific to your project

### If Document Coordination Doesn't Make Sense
- Remember routing emerges from your content needs, not preset workflows
- Request re-analysis based on your actual content creation patterns
- Clarify your intended timeline and production capacity constraints
- Ask for alternative document sequencing based on your team coordination needs

### If Quality Assurance Standards Aren't Met
- **For voice consistency issues**: Request archaeological voice DNA validation review
- **For professional standards concerns**: Clarify MDS Process methodology compliance requirements
- **For content quality problems**: Specify your authority building and professional development goals
- **For team coordination difficulties**: Request workflow optimization based on your production capacity
