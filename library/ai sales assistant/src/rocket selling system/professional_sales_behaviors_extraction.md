# üèÜ Professional Sales Behaviors - Complete Tactical Extraction

**Systematic elimination of amateur sales mistakes through professional behavior standards and execution requirements**

> **Core Principle: "How do people mess up selling? I'm gonna walk these through real quick. The five fuckups, the five F you."**

*Archaeological extraction of proven professional sales behavior methodology and amateur mistake elimination*

## üéØ Purpose

Extract the complete Professional Sales Behaviors framework for direct implementation in sales execution, preserving exact techniques for eliminating amateur mistakes and establishing professional sales standards.

### üîë Framework Foundation
- **The Five F-You's**: Complete amateur mistake identification system
- **Professional Corrections**: Specific behaviors for each failure point
- **Execution Standards**: Quality control and professional requirements
- **Systematic Implementation**: Process adherence and consistency protocols

## üìä Complete Professional Sales Behaviors Structure

### AI Summary
The Professional Sales Behaviors framework identifies the five critical mistakes that destroy sales effectiveness and provides specific professional corrections for each failure point. The system includes qualification standards, frame control requirements, discovery depth protocols, objection preparation standards, and closing behavior expectations. Implementation requires systematic adherence to professional standards, consistent execution regardless of circumstances, and quality control measures to prevent amateur behaviors from undermining sales results.

## ‚ùå The Five F-You's: Complete Amateur Mistake System

*"How do people mess up selling? I'm gonna walk these through real quick."*

### F-You #1: Don't Qualify Upfront

**Amateur Mistake:**
"They don't qualify upfront. They don't qualify. They do a bunch of calls with people that they shouldn't be talking to. You get a prospect, you get a lead, you're like, I'll do a call. I'll do a call. You got hour call meetings with people that should never been on the call."

**Professional Correction:**
- Establish qualification criteria before scheduling any sales conversation
- Screen for decision-making authority, budget, timeline, and genuine need
- Don't schedule meetings without proper qualification parameters
- Willing to disqualify poor prospects to focus on quality opportunities

**Professional Standard:**
Never invest time in unqualified prospects. Period.

### F-You #2: Don't Set the Frame

**Amateur Mistake:**
"They don't set the frame. The frame is essentially the purpose of the call."

**Professional Correction:**
- Set agenda and expectations at beginning of every call
- Establish diagnostic authority and process requirements
- Own the conversation flow and direction from first moments
- Communicate what will happen and why

**Professional Standard:**
"Setting the frame is saying right up front, here's what we're gonna do today."

**Frame Setting Script:**
"Hey, I wanna tell you about the agenda for today's call. Here's what we're gonna do today. My goal today is to figure out if I can be helpful. If I can't, I'm gonna tell you as soon as possible, and if I can, we'll talk about how that might look. Does that make sense?"

### F-You #3: Don't Control the Frame

**Amateur Mistake:**
"Don't control the frame. Some of you guys let the other person control the frame."

**Professional Correction:**
- Maintain conversation control throughout interaction
- Direct questioning and discovery process
- Handle pushback and resistance professionally
- Enforce professional boundaries consistently

**Frame Control Assessment:**
"I can literally listen to the call and just know is the other person asking a question or are you asking question, are you driving them to a specific outcome or are they driving the outcome?"

**Professional Standard:**
You ask questions, they provide answers. You drive toward diagnostic conclusions.

### F-You #4: Don't Dig Deep Enough

**Amateur Mistake:**
"They don't dig deep enough. When you're going through their current challenges, their roadblocks, their reality, like double click, ask them the impact of the current situation."

**Professional Correction:**
- Explore impact and consequences of current problems
- Ask follow-up questions to every pain point
- Let prospects sit in discomfort with status quo
- Create sufficient tension for decision-making

**Deep Digging Requirements:**
"You know, what is your biggest fear when you're building a new home? What's your biggest concern really? Has that ever happened to a friend of yours? Oh wow. What happen? Let them sit in that fear."

**Professional Standard:**
"If you don't dig deep enough to allow them to sit in the pain, that the experience so that you can then offer them a solution to get them move forward, you're not a professional."

### F-You #5: Don't Ask for the Sale

**Amateur Mistake:**
"They don't ask for the sale."

**Professional Correction:**
- Always ask for commitment at end of presentation
- Secure credit card deposit or schedule next meeting
- Never end conversation without clear next step
- Professional persistence in securing outcomes

**Professional Standard:**
"I do not get off of a Rocket selling system call without getting some dollar on a credit card as a deposit. You didn't make a sale just 'cause somebody said they wanna move forward with you."

**Professional Closing Behavior:**
"Does that make sense? Does that credit card start with a four or five? Do you have the money on you? Let's get that. That's what a salesperson does."

## üéØ Professional Behavior Standards

### Process Adherence Requirements

**Homework Assignment:**
"I want a commitment. I want you to promise that's what your homework is. I need you to promise that you'll always follow a sales process, always."

**No Exceptions Policy:**
"I don't want you to be on this call. Well, I didn't follow the process 'cause it was just a friend of mine and I know. No, I don't care if it's your mom. If this is a sales call, you follow a sales process always."

**Professional Consistency:**
"You don't deviate, you don't freestyle, you don't get cutesy. You don't think that it doesn't matter. You need to always follow the [process]."

### Quality Control Mechanisms

**Self-Assessment Questions:**
- Did I qualify this prospect before scheduling?
- Did I set and maintain frame control throughout?
- Did I dig deep enough to create real tension?
- Did I ask for the sale and secure commitment?
- Did I follow my systematic process completely?

**Professional Standards Verification:**
- Every conversation follows systematic process
- No exceptions based on relationship or circumstances
- Consistent execution regardless of comfort level
- Quality results through professional behavior

## üìã Implementation Requirements

### Professional Development Foundation

**Personal Excellence Requirement:**
"Your best self sells. Your best self sells. Your best self sells. These are gonna be tactical strategies. Very potent, very powerful. But none of this will work if you continue to drag your fucking feet to go to the gym. Don't invest in yourself. Don't keep the commitments you make to yourself in private."

**Professional Standards:**
- Maintain personal development and discipline
- Keep commitments to yourself in private
- Invest in your professional growth consistently
- Address personal issues that undermine confidence

**Belief and Authenticity:**
"It has nothing to do with the tactics, it's because you don't believe you. And when you try to communicate or try to enroll somebody into your world, it's not do they believe you? It's do they believe you believe?"

### Professional Identity Requirements

**Expert Positioning:**
- Position yourself as diagnostic expert
- Maintain professional boundaries consistently
- Focus on helping rather than selling
- Build genuine expertise in your field

**Professional Confidence:**
- Believe in your ability to deliver results
- Maintain authority throughout interactions
- Professional standards regardless of pressure
- Willing to enforce boundaries and lose poor fits
