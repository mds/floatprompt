# 🎛️ Frame Control Techniques - Complete Tactical Extraction

**Systematic conversation control methods for maintaining professional authority and directing sales interactions toward desired outcomes**

> **Core Principle: "You gotta set the frame by telling people what's gonna happen on that call. The next thing is they don't control the frame. Some of you guys let the other person control the frame."**

*Archaeological extraction of proven conversation control and authority maintenance methodology*

## 🎯 Purpose

Extract complete Frame Control Techniques for direct implementation in sales conversations, preserving exact methods for establishing, maintaining, and recovering professional authority throughout sales interactions.

### 🔑 Framework Foundation
- **Frame Setting**: Establishing conversation control from opening
- **Frame Maintenance**: Keeping control throughout interaction
- **Frame Recovery**: Regaining control when challenged
- **Professional Authority**: Maintaining expert positioning regardless of pushback

## 📊 Complete Frame Control Structure

### AI Summary
Frame Control Techniques provide systematic methods for maintaining conversation authority throughout sales interactions. The framework includes specific language patterns for setting agenda control, handling price pressure and pushback, maintaining diagnostic authority, and recovering from frame challenges. Implementation requires professional confidence, willingness to enforce boundaries, and specific scripts for common control challenges. The techniques prevent prospect-controlled interactions that lead to poor sales outcomes and maintain professional positioning throughout the entire sales process.

## 🎯 The Five Frame Control Failures

*From "The Five F-You's" - Critical frame control mistakes that destroy sales effectiveness*

### Failure #1: Don't Set the Frame

**Problem:**
"They don't set the frame. The frame is essentially the purpose of the call."

**Setting the Frame Requirements:**
- Tell people what's going to happen on the call
- Establish your role as diagnostic authority
- Set expectations for conversation flow
- Own the agenda from first moments

**Frame Setting Script:**
"Hey, I wanna tell you about the agenda for today's call. Here's what we're gonna do today. My goal today is to figure out if I can be helpful. If I can't, I'm gonna tell you as soon as possible, and if I can, we'll talk about how that might look. Does that make sense?"

### Failure #2: Don't Control the Frame

**Problem:**
"Don't control the frame. Some of you guys let the other person control the frame."

**Frame Control Indicators:**
- Who is asking questions - you or them?
- Who is driving toward specific outcome?
- Are you following your process or reacting to theirs?
- Are you maintaining diagnostic authority?

**Professional Standard:**
"I can literally listen to the call and just know is the other person asking a question or are you asking question, are you driving them to a specific outcome or are they driving the outcome?"

## 💰 Price Pressure Frame Control

*The most common frame control challenge in sales conversations*

### The Price Pressure Scenario

**Prospect Challenge:**
"I just wanna know the price. Just gimme the price."

**Stage 1 Response:**
"Well, I can't give you a price. I don't even know if I can be helpful."

**Continued Pressure:**
"Well, I mean, how much is it? Is it a lot of money?"

**Stage 2 Response:**
"Well, I can tell you it's more than a hundred dollars and it's less than a million dollars. And it all depends on specifically what you're dealing with, what the situation is. And you know, if you answer a few questions, I'll be able to give you that."

**Persistent Pressure:**
"Can you just gimme the price?"

**Final Frame Control:**
"Here's the deal. I can't give you price. I don't know the situation. Honestly, if you're not willing to have this conversation, we're not gonna have this conversation. I can give you your time back."

### Price Frame Control Principles

**Never Give Price Without Diagnosis:**
- Maintain diagnostic authority
- Require information before providing solutions
- Use price pressure as qualification tool
- Willing to end conversation if frame broken

**Progressive Frame Enforcement:**
1. **Explanation**: Why you can't give price without information
2. **Range and Conditions**: Broad range with qualification requirements
3. **Boundary Enforcement**: Clear consequence for continued pressure
4. **Conversation Termination**: Willing to end if frame cannot be maintained

## 🎛️ Conversation Control Techniques

### Agenda Ownership

**Opening Control:**
- Always set agenda at beginning of call
- Explain your process and expectations
- Get agreement to follow your diagnostic approach
- Maintain control of conversation flow

**Process Control Scripts:**
- "Here's how I work..."
- "My process is..."
- "For me to be helpful, I need to..."
- "The way this works is..."

### Question Control

**Diagnostic Authority:**
- You ask questions, they provide answers
- Redirect their questions back to diagnostic process
- Maintain information gathering role
- Control conversation direction through questioning

**Question Redirect Techniques:**
- "That's a great question, and I'll get to that. First, help me understand..."
- "Before I can answer that, I need to know..."
- "Let me ask you something first..."
- "I'll cover that. Right now, tell me about..."

### Professional Boundaries

**Boundary Setting Language:**
- "I only work with clients who..."
- "For this to work effectively..."
- "My experience shows that..."
- "I need to be direct with you..."

**Boundary Enforcement:**
- Consistent application regardless of pressure
- Clear consequences for boundary violations
- Professional tone without aggression
- Willing to end conversation if necessary

## 🔄 Frame Recovery Techniques

### When Frame is Lost

**Recognition Indicators:**
- Prospect is asking all the questions
- You're defending or explaining instead of diagnosing
- Conversation has moved away from your process
- You feel like you're chasing or convincing

**Recovery Protocol:**
1. **Pause and Reset**: "Let me step back for a moment..."
2. **Reestablish Process**: "For me to be helpful here..."
3. **Return to Diagnostic**: "Help me understand your situation..."
4. **Boundary Reinforcement**: "This is how I work most effectively..."

### Advanced Recovery Techniques

**Process Reminder:**
"I mentioned at the beginning that my goal is to figure out if I can be helpful. To do that effectively, I need to understand your situation first."

**Professional Standard:**
"I've found that the best outcomes happen when I can fully understand what you're dealing with before we talk about solutions."

**Authority Reestablishment:**
"Based on my experience working with [similar clients/situations], the most important thing right now is..."

## 📋 Frame Control Implementation Standards

### Professional Requirements

**Confidence Requirements:**
- Genuine belief in your expertise and value
- Comfort with professional boundaries
- Willingness to lose unqualified prospects
- Professional identity as expert consultant

**Language Precision:**
- Use diagnostic language consistently
- Avoid vendor or supplicant language
- Maintain professional authority tone
- Clear and direct communication

**Behavioral Standards:**
- Control conversation flow and direction
- Ask questions rather than answer questions
- Set and enforce professional boundaries
- Maintain process integrity regardless of pressure

### Quality Control Measures

**Frame Control Assessment:**
- Who is asking the majority of questions?
- Who is driving toward specific outcomes?
- Are you following your process or reacting?
- Do you feel in control or reactive?

**Professional Authority Indicators:**
- Prospect respecting your process
- Questions flowing in diagnostic direction
- Professional boundaries being maintained
- Conversation progressing according to your agenda

## 🎯 Specific Frame Control Scripts

### Agenda Setting Scripts

**Process Introduction:**
"Let me explain how this works. I'm going to ask you some questions to understand your situation, and then I'll be able to tell you if and how I can help."

**Expectation Management:**
"I don't know yet if we're a good fit. That's what we're here to figure out."

**Professional Standards:**
"I only take on clients where I'm confident I can deliver results, so I need to understand what you're dealing with first."

### Pushback Handling Scripts

**Information Resistance:**
"I understand you might have questions, and I'll answer them. But for me to give you accurate information, I need to understand your specific situation first."

**Process Resistance:**
"I know this might feel different from other conversations you've had. This diagnostic approach is how I ensure the best outcomes for my clients."

**Time Pressure:**
"I want to respect your time, which is exactly why I need to understand your situation before we discuss solutions."

### Professional Boundary Scripts

**Qualification Standards:**
"I work with [specific type of client] who [specific characteristics]. Help me understand if that describes your situation."

**Process Requirements:**
"My process requires [specific requirements]. Are you comfortable with that approach?"

**Professional Limits:**
"If I can't help you get the results you need, I'll be direct about that and potentially refer you to someone who can."
