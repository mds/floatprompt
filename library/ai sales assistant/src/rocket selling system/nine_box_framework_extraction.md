# 🚀 9-Box Rocket Selling Framework - Complete Tactical Extraction

**Systematic conversation architecture for enrollment-based selling from opening to commitment**

> **Core Philosophy: "I don't sell shit. I literally go, here's what I got, but by the time I do the 'here's what I got,' I created no other option for the other person than to decide to move forward."**

*Archaeological extraction of proven systematic sales methodology with documented $2M results*

## 🎯 Purpose

Extract the complete 9-box Rocket Selling Framework for direct implementation in sales conversations, preserving exact tactical questions, scripts, and conversation flow methodology.

### 🔑 Framework Foundation
- **Three-Phase Structure**: Audition → Stretch → Solution/Enrollment
- **Systematic Approach**: Nine specific boxes with tactical implementation
- **Enrollment Focus**: Creating enrollment rather than selling resistance
- **Proven Results**: $2M generated by student using this exact system

## 📊 Complete 9-Box Framework Structure

### AI Summary
The 9-Box Rocket Selling Framework transforms sales conversations from pitch-based approaches to systematic enrollment through three phases. Phase 1 (Audition) establishes frame control and relationship context. Phase 2 (Stretch) creates tension between current reality and desired outcomes. Phase 3 (Solution/Enrollment) presents methodology and secures commitment. Each box contains specific tactical questions and conversation management techniques designed to create no other option but forward movement. The system requires strict adherence to process and includes timing guidelines for optimal implementation.

## 🎭 PHASE 1: AUDITION (Boxes 1-3)

*"You have to audition. You are the prize. They need to confirm that they're the kind of person that can receive the prize."*

### Box 1: Agenda Setting & Frame Control

**Opening Script (Exact):**
"Hey, I wanna tell you about the agenda for today's call. Here's what we're gonna do today. My goal today is to figure out if I can be helpful. If I can't, I'm gonna tell you as soon as possible, and if I can, we'll talk about how that might look. Does that make sense?"

**Key Tactical Elements:**
- Own the agenda immediately - "You have to own the agenda"
- Establish diagnostic frame - "My goal is to figure out if I can be helpful"
- Set expectation of possible rejection - "If I can't, I'm gonna tell you as soon as possible"
- Confirm understanding - "Does that make sense?"

**Timing:** 2 minutes maximum
**Frame:** Doctor frame - diagnosis before prescription

### Box 2: Customer Discovery

**The Three Essential Questions:**
1. "Who do you serve?" (Who's a perfect customer for you?)
2. "What do you do for them?"
3. "How does that work?"

**Implementation Protocol:**
- Ask questions in sequence
- Write down responses - "Write it down. Take notes."
- Allow them to relax through understanding
- Essential principle: "If I don't feel like you understand my situation, I'm not buying shit"

**Purpose:** Immediate understanding of their world and customer base

### Box 3: Context Building

**The Two Game-Changing Questions:**

**Question 1: "Why me?"**
- "What is it about our company that made you decide to reach out?"
- Find out who referred them
- Find out where they saw you
- Get complete connection context

**Question 2: "Why now?"**
- "What's going on that made you decide to reach out?"
- "What's going on that made you decide to [take action]?"
- Build context of their current world and challenges

**Tactical Impact:**
- "Why me?" creates perfect frame - "they go on their toes to sell me to me"
- Seven-year follower vs. viral reel viewer - different buying readiness
- "Why now?" builds urgency context and situational pressure

**Total Audition Time:** Approximately 10 minutes

## 🎯 PHASE 2: STRETCH (Boxes 4-6)

*"The sale is made in between current reality and desired outcome. To the degree that I can put a peg in the ground on their pain of inaction, their pain of their current situation, and then I pull it out and help them suspend disbelief, that tension is where the sale happens."*

### Box 4: Results Exploration (Dream State)

**Core Question Framework:**
"What do you want to achieve in the next 12 months? You wake up, you wave a magic wand. Everything's come true. All your dreams, all your goals. Tell me about it."

**Tactical Variations by Business Type:**
- Money situation: "Tell me about the financial outcome"
- Lifestyle: "What does that look like from a lifestyle perspective?"
- Impact: "What kind of impact do you wanna have?"
- Calendar/Productivity: "What about your calendar? Are you overwhelmed?"
- Health/Feeling: "How do you wanna feel?"

**Advanced Questioning Technique:**
"We're gonna meet up in 12 months in your favorite city, in your favorite restaurant, and we're toasting to an incredible year. What are we celebrating?"

**Handling Resistance:**
"They'll be like, well, I don't know. I know you don't know, but if you pretended like you did, what would it be?"

### Box 5: Reality Assessment (Current Situation)

**Transition Script:**
"Sounds exciting. Let's switch to where you're at today."

**Discovery Questions:**
- "Tell me more about your team"
- "Tell me about your revenue. Where are you at today?"
- "You want to be at a million in 12 months. What's it look like today?"
- "Do you have investors?"
- "Tell me about [relevant situation details]"

**Purpose:** Gather data points for customized solution presentation
**Requirement:** "Allow them to express the pain"

### Box 6: Roadblocks Identification

**Primary Question:**
"It sounds like you have a good understanding of what you're dealing with and kind of what you wanna achieve. If we had to make a list of like three to five things that are getting in the way from making this really easy, what would you say is on that list?"

**Critical Implementation:**
- Write down each roadblock
- Get 3-5 specific obstacles
- Document for later use in offer loop
- Don't celebrate or minimize - find problems to solve

**Professional Behavior Note:**
"Most people release the pressure valve. Women, you're the worst at this. When somebody gives you a win, you're like, oh my God, that's amazing. Here's the problem when you do that, you didn't create any problem for them to solve."

## 🎯 PHASE 3: SOLUTION & ENROLLMENT (Boxes 7-9)

### Box 7: Methodology Presentation

**Transition Script:**
"Okay, well based on where you're at and where you want to go, and the roadblocks, I feel like I got a really good understanding of where you're at, where you wanna go from here. So where do you want to go from here?"

**Expected Response:**
99% of prospects will ask: "Well, what do you think we should do? Where do you want to go from here? How does it work?"

**Methodology Presentation:**
"Well, let me just share a bit more about the way we work"
- Present your process/method/framework
- Draw visual (triangle or diagram)
- Explain unique approach based on history and research
- Make it feel concrete and thoughtful

**Framework Examples:**
- Agency: "Growth Ceiling" methodology
- Coaching: "Elite Growth Model"
- Custom approach based on business type

### Box 8: Offer Presentation

**Structure Framework:**
"Well, here's the way we think about it. You wanna have the plan, the tools and the support."

**Three Components Always:**
1. **The Plan:** "We do this, this, this, and this"
2. **The Tools:** "Because we like to do the best work, we use these tools and these tools are how we integrate and how we communicate"
3. **The Support:** "We understand that a lot of people in this situation have these concerns, and that's why we have these levels of support in place"

**Pricing Delivery:**
- State price: "Well, it's only $25,000"
- Immediately move on: "But because we understand that for you to really grow, you need to train up your team, we also allow you to add two extra team members at no additional fee"
- Never stay on price - always move forward

### Box 9: Enrollment Decision

**Two Options Only:**
1. **Credit Card on Call:** "Perfect. I just texted you the link. Click that link. I'll be on the call with you. Just enter your credit card that puts a deposit that'll kick off a notification to my team."
2. **BAMFAM (Book A Meeting From A Meeting):** If they can't decide on current call

**Professional Standard:**
"I do not get off of a Rocket selling system call without getting some dollar on a credit card as a deposit. You didn't make a sale just 'cause somebody said they wanna move forward with you."

## 📋 Critical Implementation Standards

### Process Adherence Requirements
- "Always follow a sales process, always"
- "I don't care if it's your mom. If this is a sales call, you follow a sales process"
- "You don't deviate, you don't freestyle, you don't get cutesy"
- "You don't think that it doesn't matter"

### Timing Guidelines
- Audition Phase: ~10 minutes
- Stretch Phase: Variable based on depth needed
- Solution/Enrollment: Move efficiently through methodology to commitment

### Quality Control Mechanisms
- Write down responses throughout
- Never celebrate wins during discovery
- Dig deep enough to create real tension
- Always ask for the sale or next meeting
