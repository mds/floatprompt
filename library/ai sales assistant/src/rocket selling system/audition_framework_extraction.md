# üé≠ Audition Framework - Complete Tactical Extraction

**Authority positioning system that transforms seller from pursuer to prize through diagnostic frame establishment**

> **Core Principle: "You have to audition. You are the prize. They need to confirm that they're the kind of person that can receive the prize. They have to sell you on wanting to do business with them."**

*Archaeological extraction of proven authority positioning and frame control methodology*

## üéØ Purpose

Extract the complete Audition Framework for direct implementation in sales conversations, preserving exact techniques for establishing proper authority positioning and diagnostic frame control from first contact.

### üîë Framework Foundation
- **Prize Positioning**: "You are the prize" mindset and behavior
- **Doctor Frame**: Diagnostic approach rather than vendor approach
- **Audition Dynamic**: They prove worthiness rather than you proving value
- **Frame Control**: Maintaining authority throughout interaction

## üìä Complete Audition Framework Structure

### AI Summary
The Audition Framework reverses traditional sales dynamics by positioning the seller as the prize and requiring prospects to audition for the opportunity to work together. The technique uses doctor frame methodology - diagnostic approach focused on determining if you can help rather than convincing them to buy. Implementation requires specific language patterns, authority positioning behaviors, and frame control techniques that maintain professional boundaries while gathering qualification information. The framework prevents desperate seller positioning and creates scarcity psychology that increases perceived value.

## üèÜ Core Audition Philosophy

*"Most people when they're selling, they think like, I gotta do this whole like song and dance and like try to impress them and all this. No, you don't."*

### Fundamental Frame Shift

**Traditional Seller Frame:**
- Seller tries to impress prospect
- Seller proves value and worth
- Seller chases and pursues
- Seller fears rejection

**Audition Frame:**
- Prospect proves they're qualified
- Prospect demonstrates worthiness
- Prospect pursues opportunity
- Seller evaluates fit

### Prize Positioning Requirements

**Mental Frame:**
- You are the expert with limited capacity
- Your time and expertise are valuable
- You only work with qualified, committed clients
- You have nothing to prove, only value to assess

**Behavioral Implementation:**
- Professional boundaries from first contact
- Diagnostic questions rather than impressive presentations
- Qualification requirements before proceeding
- Willingness to disqualify poor fits

## ü©∫ Doctor Frame Methodology

*"It's called the doctor frame. We'll talk more about that in a sec."*

### Doctor Frame Characteristics

**Diagnostic Authority:**
- Doctor diagnoses before prescribing
- Doctor has nothing to sell until diagnosis complete
- Doctor may refer to specialist if not right fit
- Doctor maintains professional boundaries

**Patient Relationship Dynamic:**
- Patient seeks help from expert
- Patient answers questions for proper diagnosis
- Patient follows doctor's recommendations
- Patient respects doctor's expertise and time

### Implementation in Sales Context

**Your Role as "Doctor":**
- Diagnose their situation before offering solutions
- Maintain professional authority and boundaries
- Focus on understanding rather than impressing
- Willing to "refer" if not right fit

**Prospect's Role as "Patient":**
- Seeking expert help for their problems
- Answers diagnostic questions honestly
- Respects your professional process
- Demonstrates worthiness for your expertise

## üéØ Tactical Audition Implementation

### Opening Frame Control

**Agenda Setting Script:**
"Hey, I wanna tell you about the agenda for today's call. Here's what we're gonna do today. My goal today is to figure out if I can be helpful. If I can't, I'm gonna tell you as soon as possible, and if I can, we'll talk about how that might look. Does that make sense?"

**Frame Elements:**
- **Ownership**: "I wanna tell you about the agenda"
- **Authority**: "Here's what we're gonna do"
- **Diagnostic**: "Figure out if I can be helpful"
- **Professional Boundaries**: "If I can't, I'm gonna tell you"
- **Conditional Engagement**: "If I can, we'll talk about how that might look"

### Authority Language Patterns

**Conditional Language:**
- "If I can be helpful..."
- "We'll see if this makes sense..."
- "I'll need to understand your situation first..."
- "Let me see if we're a good fit..."

**Professional Boundaries:**
- "I only work with clients who..."
- "For this to work, you'll need to..."
- "I'll be direct with you if I don't think..."
- "My process requires..."

**Diagnostic Focus:**
- "Let me understand your situation..."
- "I need to get clear on..."
- "Help me understand..."
- "Walk me through..."

## üîç Qualification Through Audition

### Context Building Questions

**Why Me Question:**
"What is it about our company that made you decide to reach out?"

**Strategic Purpose:**
- Forces them to sell you to you
- Reveals their research and commitment level
- Identifies referral source and credibility
- Creates perfect audition frame

**Implementation:**
- Ask directly and wait for complete answer
- Listen for depth of research and follow-time
- Assess commitment level based on response
- Use information to gauge buying readiness

**Quality Indicators:**
- **High Quality**: "I've been following you for seven years..."
- **Medium Quality**: "Someone referred me because..."
- **Low Quality**: "I saw some viral reel..."

### Why Now Question

**Core Question:**
"Why now? What's going on that made you decide to reach out?"

**Strategic Purpose:**
- Identifies urgency and timing factors
- Reveals situational pressure and motivation
- Builds context for their current challenges
- Assesses real vs. manufactured urgency

**Follow-up Probing:**
- "What's changed recently?"
- "What's the timeline pressure?"
- "What happens if this doesn't get resolved?"
- "How long have you been thinking about this?"

## üõ°Ô∏è Frame Control Maintenance

### Handling Frame Challenges

**Price Pressure Example:**
Prospect: "I just wanna know the price. Just gimme the price."

**Frame Control Response:**
"Well, I can't give you a price. I don't even know if I can be helpful. I mean, how much is it? Is it a lot of money? Well, I can tell you it's more than a hundred dollars and it's less than a million dollars. And it all depends on specifically what you're dealing with, what the situation is. And if you answer a few questions, I'll be able to give you that."

**Escalation if Resistance Continues:**
"Can you just gimme the price? Here's the deal. I can't give you price. I don't know the situation. Honestly, if you're not willing to have this conversation, we're not gonna have this conversation. I can give you your time back."

### Professional Boundary Enforcement

**Frame Control Principles:**
- Never break frame for convenience
- Maintain professional standards regardless of pressure
- Willing to end conversation if frame broken
- Professional boundaries create respect and value

**Quality Control Questions:**
- Who is asking questions - you or them?
- Who is driving toward specific outcome?
- Are you maintaining diagnostic authority?
- Are they proving worthiness or are you proving value?

## üìã Audition Behavioral Standards

### Professional Requirements

**Qualification Upfront:**
- Don't do calls with unqualified prospects
- Establish minimum requirements before scheduling
- Screen for decision-making authority
- Confirm budget and timeline parameters

**Agenda Ownership:**
- Always set agenda at beginning
- Maintain control of conversation flow
- Direct questioning and discovery process
- Guide toward diagnostic conclusions

**Diagnostic Authority:**
- Focus on understanding before presenting
- Ask questions rather than making statements
- Gather information before offering solutions
- Maintain professional curiosity and expertise

### Common Frame Breaks to Avoid

**Supplicant Positioning:**
- Trying to impress with credentials
- Over-explaining value before diagnosis
- Accepting poor behavior from prospects
- Chasing unqualified opportunities

**Vendor Mentality:**
- Leading with features and benefits
- Answering questions before asking questions
- Accepting "just give me the price" dynamic
- Tolerating poor prospect engagement

**Frame Recovery Techniques:**
- Return to diagnostic questions
- Reestablish professional boundaries
- Reference agenda and process
- Willing to end if frame cannot be maintained

## üéØ Integration with Sales Process

### Pre-Audition Setup
- Clear value proposition established
- Professional positioning and credentials
- Qualification criteria defined
- Willing to disqualify poor fits

### Post-Audition Transition
- Move to discovery and stretch phases
- Maintain authority throughout process
- Use qualification information for customization
- Reference audition insights in solution presentation

### Quality Assurance Checkpoints
- Frame control maintained throughout
- Prospect demonstrating worthiness
- Diagnostic authority established
- Professional boundaries respected

## üõ°Ô∏è Archaeological Preservation Notes
