# üåü Five-Star Prospect Qualifier - Sales Assistant Tool

**Systematic prospect qualification framework for chat sales effectiveness and time protection**

## üéØ AI Summary

This extraction preserves the Five-Star Prospect qualification system for implementation as a sales assistant tool. The framework provides five non-negotiable criteria for evaluating whether a prospect deserves continued conversation investment. Originally taught as a foundational filter for chat sales, this system protects time and improves conversation quality by establishing clear qualification standards before moving forward with sales processes.

## üéØ Core Framework: Five-Star Prospect System

*Source: "I got it from my buddy Gene Dean Jackson. He's one of the world's best marketers."*

### **Qualification Authority**

"So there's five things that have to be true for somebody you're chatting with to be somebody that you would even move forward in a sales conversation. Okay? So these are the five things that for me, are non-negotiable."

### **The Five Non-Negotiable Criteria**

#### **‚≠ê Star 1: They Engage and Reply**
**Original Teaching**: "One that they engage and they reply, okay? If somebody does not reply. They don't engage, then they are not a five star prospect. That's number one."

**Implementation**: Basic responsiveness requirement - prospect must demonstrate active participation in conversation.

#### **‚≠ê Star 2: They Are Friendly and Cooperative** 
**Original Teaching**: "Number two is that they are friendly and cooperative. Okay? Hostile people can go away, okay? Friendly and cooperative. If you guys are chatting with folks and they're, they're not replying or they're rude, bounce, move on. You don't need them. You don't want them in your world, okay? If they can't even be polite in a basic conversation, especially if they followed you or they're following you or they engage in your content, move on. Okay?"

**Implementation**: Attitude and cooperation filter - eliminates hostile or difficult prospects immediately.

#### **‚≠ê Star 3: They Know What They Want**
**Original Teaching**: "Number three is they know what they want, man, know what they want. I remember one time I was talking to an entrepreneur and I was trying to understand what he was challenged with, and he just kept talking in circles. And at one point I had to stop him and I said, dude, talking to you is like hugging, like vapor. I can't put my arms around it. It's like, I don't even know what you do. And you've been talking for 18 minutes. Like some people don't know what they want. If they don't know what they want, then they're not a conversation you should pursue. Okay? You're not here to convince people of what they want. They need to know what they want."

**Implementation**: Clarity requirement - prospect must articulate clear problems or goals, no circular conversations.

#### **‚≠ê Star 4: They're Ready to Get It**
**Original Teaching**: "Number four is that they're ready to get it. They, they're ready now. They want, they actually want to get the thing to solve the problems. Okay. They're ready to get it. Okay. So it's a now thing. So I always ask people, is this a now thing or a later thing? They're like, it's a now thing. Perfect. Okay?"

**Implementation**: Timing qualification - prospects must be ready for immediate action, not future consideration.

#### **‚≠ê Star 5: They Want Your Help**
**Original Teaching**: "And five, they want your help. Okay. If they don't want your help, they ain't a five star prospect."

**Implementation**: Authority acceptance - prospect must specifically want your assistance, not just general information.

## ü§ñ Sales Assistant Implementation

### **Qualification Evaluation Process**

**Input Format**: Describe prospect interaction or conversation details
**Output Format**: QUALIFIED/NOT QUALIFIED + reasoning + next steps

### **Evaluation Questions for AI Assistant**

For each criterion, the AI assistant evaluates:

1. **Engagement Level**: "Are they responding promptly and meaningfully to messages?"
2. **Cooperation Assessment**: "Are they polite, respectful, and easy to work with?"
3. **Clarity Check**: "Can they clearly articulate what they want or need?"
4. **Timing Verification**: "Is this a 'now thing' or 'later thing' for them?"
5. **Help Acceptance**: "Do they specifically want your help or just general information?"

### **Decision Framework**

**Five Stars (5/5)**: QUALIFIED - Proceed with conversation
**Four Stars or Less (4/5 or below)**: NOT QUALIFIED - Move on

"These are the things that when I'm chatting or having my team chat with people to open them up to have a conversation potentially working with me, that's what they're asking questions around to qualify."

## üéØ AI Assistant Tool Specifications

### **Tool Function**: Prospect Qualification Evaluator

**Role**: "You are a chat sales qualification specialist. When I describe a prospect interaction, evaluate them against the Five-Star Prospect criteria and give me a clear QUALIFIED/NOT QUALIFIED decision with reasoning."

### **Input Examples**:
- "Here's our conversation thread..."
- "Prospect responded to my outreach with..."
- "They've been chatting but..."

### **Output Template**:
```
QUALIFICATION STATUS: [QUALIFIED/NOT QUALIFIED]

EVALUATION BREAKDOWN:
‚≠ê Engagement: [Assessment]
‚≠ê Cooperation: [Assessment] 
‚≠ê Clarity: [Assessment]
‚≠ê Timing: [Assessment]
‚≠ê Help Seeking: [Assessment]

STAR RATING: [X/5]

NEXT STEPS: [Specific recommendation]
```

### **Boundary Enforcement**

**Time Protection**: "You don't need them. You don't want them in your world"
**Professional Standards**: Clear qualification requirements prevent wasted conversation investment
**Authority Maintenance**: Non-negotiable criteria establish professional boundaries

## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### **Qualification Questions to Ask Prospects**

Based on the framework, AI can suggest qualification questions:

- **For Clarity**: "What specifically are you looking to achieve?"
- **For Timing**: "Is this something you're looking to address now or more of a future consideration?"
- **For Help Seeking**: "Are you looking for someone to help you with this, or just gathering information?"

### **Red Flag Detection**

**Immediate Disqualification Signals**:
- Non-responsive or delayed engagement
- Rude or hostile communication
- Circular conversation without clear direction
- "I'm just looking around" mentality
- Information seeking without help acceptance

### **Professional Boundary Maintenance**

"If they can't even be polite in a basic conversation, especially if they followed you or they're following you or they engage in your content, move on."

## üéØ Usage Patterns for Sales Assistant

### **Daily Qualification Workflow**
1. **Prospect Interaction Occurs**
2. **Input to AI**: Conversation details or prospect behavior
3. **AI Evaluation**: Five-star assessment with reasoning
4. **Decision**: Proceed or move on based on qualification
5. **Time Protection**: Focus energy on qualified prospects only

### **Team Training Integration**
- Standardized qualification criteria across team members
- Consistent prospect evaluation standards
- Reduced time waste on unqualified conversations
- Professional boundary enforcement

### **Performance Optimization**
- Track qualification accuracy over time
- Measure time saved through proper qualification
- Monitor conversation quality improvement
- Optimize qualification questions based on results

## üõ°Ô∏è Archaeological Preservation Notes

**Voice Maintained**: Direct, non-negotiable authority from original teaching
**Methodology Preserved**: Exact five-criteria system without modification
**Implementation Focus**: Practical application for chat sales contexts
**Professional Standards**: Boundary maintenance and time protection emphasis

**Original Authority**: "These are the five things that for me, are non-negotiable."

## Implementation Notes

This extraction maintains the systematic qualification methodology while adapting it for AI assistant implementation. The framework serves as a foundational filter for all subsequent chat sales activities, protecting time and ensuring conversation quality through non-negotiable standards.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Compliance

Archaeological extraction maintains original teaching voice and methodology. Professional boundary enforcement preserved throughout implementation guidelines. Time protection and quality standards maintained per original framework authority.

**Built in collaboration with Claude Sonnet for systematic prospect qualification**

*Qualification precision serves time protection through systematic prospect evaluation.*
