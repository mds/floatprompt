# 🧠 SBC Extraction #4 — Conversation Analyzer Enhancements

## 🎯 Buyer Scoring Rubric (Verbatim)

> “Provide a score from 1–10 estimating where the prospect is in the buyer’s journey & what they said to indicate your answer.”

```
1 = Not very familiar with you / just started following
3 = Familiar but not looking for help
7 = Got some value from your work
10 = Seeking to work with you
```

---

## 🔄 Handoff Recognition Point
> “Indicate WHERE in the conversation that a HANDOFF should have occurred from an Opener to a Closer.”

**Trigger Criteria:**
- Prospect is open to discussing outside help
- Prospect is qualified (meets revenue and readiness)
- Tip of iceberg pain is identified
- Conversation is stable, responsive, and emotionally present

---

## 🧍‍♂️ Lean-Out Pattern Recognition
> “The fastest way to lose a sale is to oversell. We must lean out when prospects are leaning out.”

**Key Lean-Out Phrases:**
- “All good dude”
- “Only working with doers”
- “Can only help people swimming toward me”
- “Let me know if you get stuck or want to move faster”
- “Circle back when you’re ready”

**Behavioral Logic:**
- Use lean-out framing only when buyer hesitates
- Protect posture by backing off rather than pressing forward
- Preserve authority by signaling scarcity, not neediness

---

## ✅ Integration Notes for Conversation Analyzer
- Insert scoring rubric near top of analyzer sequence
- Follow with handoff criteria as mid-conversation detection logic
- Add lean-out phrases to end-state objection/posture module
