# 🛡️ SBC Extraction #2 — Objections & Follow-Up

## 💬 Conditional Objection Templates

### **💸 Price Objection** — “Too expensive”
```
Message 1: Totally get it. Finances aside, what do you think about the program?
Message 2: I love it, blah blah. [← Expected response to unlock continued interest]
```

### **⏰ Time Objection** — “I don’t have the time”
```
Message 1: Totally get it! You want to make sure you have time to implement
Message 2: Some of our best clients see results with as little as 2 hours a week
Message 3: Do you think you could find 2 hours to “get to your goal?”

→ If yes:
Message 4: One of my mentors said, “If you don’t sacrifice for what you want, then what you want becomes the sacrifice.”
Message 5: Are you willing to sacrifice a bit of downtime to build your business?
```

### **🧍‍♂️ DIY Objection** — “I want to do it on my own”
```
Message 1: Totally get that! And I respect your hustle. Is that the only thing holding you back?
→ If yes:
Message 2: Is that what you’d advise your potential clients to do?
Message 3: You could waste months when you could just get results faster.
Message 4: That’s why your clients hire you.
Message 5: Would you rather figure it out alone or start now and sign clients in 30 days?
```

### **📆 12-Month Commitment Objection**
```
Message 1: Totally understand. Is the 12-month commitment the only thing holding you back?
→ If yes:
Message 2: Start with the monthly and upgrade after quick wins.
Message 3: Cancel anytime if not happy. Would that help you get started today?
```

### **🗓️ “Next Week” Delay Objection**
```
Message 1: What’s holding you back from getting started today?
Message 2: 99% of “next week” = never. Let’s start now and build your dream together.
Message 3: If I let you off the hook, I let you down. Time to fully commit?
```

### **🧾 Free Trial Gambit**
```
Message 1: I have to honour my other clients’ investments — when you pay, you pay attention.
```

## 🔥 Commitment Testing Prompts
- “How important is this to you on a scale of 1–10?”
- “Is this a NICE to have or a MUST-have?”
- “Is this a now or a later thing?”
- “Are you ready to commit or would you rather settle?”

---

## 🔁 Follow-Up Sequences

### **If ghosted for 30–60 min:**
- ❤️ React to last message
- ✅ Engage with their profile (like a post/story)

### **Ping Cadence:**
```
After 60 min: “Get my note?” or “Ping^ ;)” or “[Name]?”
Next day: “Morning!”
24hr → 3d → 7d → 14d → 21d sequence
```

### **Re-engagement bump copy:**
- “Sorry I got busy 😅”
- “Sorry if I offended you…”
- “Still curious where your head’s at on this…”

---

## 🚧 Offer Gate Protocol
**Rule**: Never pitch offer unless 9+ back-and-forth messages have occurred.

---

## ✅ Integration Notes for Document 11
- Insert each objection tree as-is, no flattening
- Label commitment prompts as **escalation triggers**
- Add follow-up bump logic as its own callout section
- Position 9-message offer gate early in the document as a systemic boundary
