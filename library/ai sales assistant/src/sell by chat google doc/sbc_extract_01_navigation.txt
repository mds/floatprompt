# üß≠ SBC Extraction #1 ‚Äî Navigation Enhancements

## üîÅ CRM Tagging Protocol (Direct from SBC Playbook)

**Pipeline Stages:**
- **Lead** ‚Üí Anyone with whom we are conversing
- **Qualified** ‚Üí Open to help and revenue at/above [Insert here]
- **Offer Made** ‚Üí Offer has been presented
- **Closed Won** ‚Üí Confirmed sale
- **Closed Lost** ‚Üí Disqualified, unresponsive, or deferred

**Tag Triggers:**
- Tag `lead` ‚Üí auto-create deal in SBC Social
- Tag `qualified` ‚Üí move deal to Qualified stage
- Tag `offer presented` ‚Üí move to Offer Presented pipeline
- Tag `Closed Won` ‚Üí mark as Won, move to Closed Won
- Tag `Closed Lost` ‚Üí mark as Lost, move to Closed Lost

---

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Role Segmentation Logic

### **Opener Responsibilities:**
- Monitor notifications: likes, follows, views, DMs, mentions
- Use personalized opens with emojis üí™üëåüöÄ üëä
- Qualify with SBC framework, stretch the gap
- Tag appropriately
- **Hand off at qualification + tip of iceberg pain discovery**

### **Closer Responsibilities:**
- Take ownership of all qualified convos
- Deepen pain, extract roadblocks, handle objections
- Test urgency and commitment
- Present offer only when 9-message threshold reached
- Tag and track every movement in pipeline

---

## üîî Notification-Based Opportunity Triggers

- New follower = open with personalized message
- Story view = check for profile signals, initiate open
- Comment/like = surface conversation opportunity
- Message request = treat as live inbound lead
- Mention = possible referral or interest signal

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tag Automation Logic

```yaml
if tag == "lead":
  create_deal(stage="Lead")

if tag == "qualified":
  move_deal(stage="Qualified")

if tag == "offer presented":
  move_deal(stage="Offer Made")

if tag == "Closed Won":
  mark_deal("won")
  move_deal(stage="Closed Won")

if tag == "Closed Lost":
  mark_deal("lost")
  move_deal(stage="Closed Lost")
```

## üßæ Notes for Integration into Navigation Document

- Embed above logic under **Routing Logic** in Document 6
- Precede conversation flow decision trees with **tag-state check**
- Treat opener/closer protocol as preconditions for tool selection
- Tag logic powers both AI and human routing across stages
