# üß† Chat Sales Assistant - Master Navigation System

**MDS Process: Map lead score ‚Üí Decide navigation routes ‚Üí Structure response**

*Master navigation authority for IG DM sales conversations with intelligent routing to tactical documents and SBC message suggestions.*

## üéØ **MDS Process Framework**

### **MAP** ‚Üí Lead Scoring Intelligence
**Source**: Five-Star Methodology + SBC Buyer Journey Integration

#### **Five-Star Qualification Assessment:**
1. **‚≠ê Engagement** - They engage and reply promptly
2. **‚≠ê Cooperation** - Friendly and cooperative attitude  
3. **‚≠ê Clarity** - They know what they want (clear goals)
4. **‚≠ê Timing** - Ready to get it now (not later)
5. **‚≠ê Help-Seeking** - They want your help specifically

#### **SBC Buyer Journey Scoring (1-10):**
```
1-3 = Not familiar with getting better at design / discovering needs
4-6 = Familiar with improvement but not actively seeking structured help  
7-8 = Engaged with design content and showing professional development interest
9-10 = Actively seeking guidance and ready for professional advancement investment
```

#### **Message Gate Assessment:**
- **Below 9 messages**: NO OFFER ALLOWED (SBC compliance)
- **9+ messages**: GATE OPEN for offer presentation
- **Professional conversation depth required before premium pricing revelation**

#### **Pipeline Stage Classification:**
- **Lead**: Initial contact, qualification in progress
- **Qualified**: 5/5 stars confirmed, gap development ready
- **Offer Made**: Offer has been presented (9+ messages + direct ask completed)
- **Closed Won**: Confirmed sale with commitment
- **Closed Lost**: Disqualified, unresponsive, or deferred

### üö® Error Pattern Detection
**Source Integration**: `conversation_analyzer.md`

#### **The Three Biggest Mistakes:**
1. **Mistake #1**: Solving problems in DMs (giving away solutions for free)
2. **Mistake #2**: Friend zone reciprocal Q&A (losing professional frame)
3. **Mistake #3**: No curiosity creation (ending without value demonstration)

#### **Additional Error Patterns:**
- **Premature pitching** (before 9-message threshold)
- **No specific next step** (ending without commitment)
- **Frame loss** (allowing prospect to control conversation)
- **Solution leak** (answering technical questions without qualification)

## üéØ **DECIDE** ‚Üí Navigation Routes
