Subject: Quick question about your design work

Hey [Name],

Saw your [specific work/post] and had a question.

Where are you at with feeling confident explaining your design decisions? Like when stakeholders ask "why did you choose this?" do you have a clear way to walk them through it?

I'm trying to figure out if you're looking for structured training or just general design inspiration.

What's your timeline looking like for leveling up your design process?

Matt
```

#### **A→B Gap Presentation Adaptation**:
```
Subject: The gap I'm seeing in your design process

Hey [Name],

So based on what you told me, you're at [current confidence level] with design decisions but you want to get to [goal level].

Here's what I'm seeing. That gap between where you are and where you want to be? It's costing you opportunities. I've worked with tons of designers who had the same exact issue.

When you can't confidently explain your design decisions, you miss out on promotions, better projects, and respect from stakeholders. I've seen this over and over.

The approach I teach typically helps designers close that gap in 6-12 months. Not kidding. I have students who went from junior to senior positions because they could finally articulate their design thinking.

Want to talk about how this would work for your situation?

Matt
```

#### **Close Sequence Adaptation**:
```
Subject: Here's how we can work together

Hey [Name],

I'd love to help you with this. Here's how it works.

I have a training program that teaches exactly what we've been talking about. It's $1997 for the year and includes everything you need to build confidence in your design decisions.

I've been doing this for almost two decades. The designers who go through this program consistently see career advancement within 6-12 months because they can finally explain their work clearly.

Most companies will reimburse this as professional development. It's a pretty easy sell to your manager.

The program includes the framework, community access (we have designers from Netflix, Figma, R/GA), and direct access to me for questions.

Are you ready to get started?
