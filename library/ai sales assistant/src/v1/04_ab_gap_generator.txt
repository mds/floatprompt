## ⚠️ Critical Warning: Question Selection Safety Protocol

### **The Fatal Mistake**
*Source: "Now I will say the mistake a lot of people make is they ask a question that the prospect or the buyer can't answer. Okay? This happens in software world all the time... You never ask a question that you don't think the buyer can actually answer."*

**Conversation-Killing Examples for Sarah Shift**:
- "What's your design system component library architecture?" (Too technical, requires research)
- "How many design tokens do you currently manage?" (Specific data they don't track)
- "What's your team's design compliance percentage?" (Data they haven't measured)

### **Sarah Shift Safe Gap Questions**

#### **✅ Green Light Questions (Safe to Ask)**
- "How confident do you feel explaining your design decisions to stakeholders?"
- "Where do you see yourself professionally in 12 months with design skills?"
- "How often do colleagues ask you for design advice?"
- "What's your current approach to design decision-making?"

#### **❌ Red Light Questions (Conversation Killers)**
- "What's your team's design system token architecture?" (Technical specifications)
- "How many design frameworks have you implemented?" (Data collection required)
- "What's your company's design maturity assessment score?" (Research needed)

### **Safety Check Process**
Before suggesting gap questions, evaluate:
1. "Can Sarah answer this immediately based on daily work experience?"
2. "Does this require research, data collection, or technical analysis?"
3. "Would this create a 'get ready to work with you' response requiring preparation?"

## 🎯 SBC Commitment Testing Integration

*Source: SBC Extract #2 - Objections & Follow-Up*

### **Commitment Testing Prompts for Gap Amplification**
- **"How important is getting better at design to you on a scale of 1–10?"**
- **"Is building confidence a NICE to have or a MUST-have for your career?"**
- **"Is leveling up a now or a later thing for your professional development?"**
- **"Are you ready to commit to getting better or would you rather settle for current confidence level?"**

### **Commitment Testing Application After Gap Identification**
```
GAP IDENTIFIED: Design confidence gap affecting professional advancement
COMMITMENT TEST: "How important is design confidence to you on a scale of 1-10?"
RESPONSE CALIBRATION: 
- 8-10: Proceed to close sequence with premium investment positioning
- 6-7: Address urgency and amplify advancement timeline pressure
