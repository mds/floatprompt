## 🌟 Core Framework: Five-Star Prospect System

*Source: "So there's five things that have to be true for somebody you're chatting with to be somebody that you would even move forward in a sales conversation. Okay? So these are the five things that for me, are non-negotiable."*

- "Do they show active engagement when talking about professional development?"
- "Are they keeping the conversation going around goals for leveling up?"

### **⭐ Star 2: They Are Friendly and Cooperative**
**Original Teaching**: "Number two is that they are friendly and cooperative. Okay? Hostile people can go away, okay? Friendly and cooperative.

I remember one time I was talking to an entrepreneur and I was trying to understand what he was challenged with, and he just kept talking in circles... some people don't know what they want. If they don't know what they want, then they're not a conversation you should pursue."

**Sarah Shift Calibration**:
- Clear articulation of confidence gaps and professional advancement goals
- Specific understanding of current limitations and where they want to get better
- Focused professional development objectives rather than vague improvement desires

**Assessment Questions**:
- "Can they clearly describe their confidence gaps and professional advancement timeline?"
- "Do they articulate specific needs for getting better at design beyond vague improvement goals?"

- **LATER**: Vague future timing, no current budget allocation, getting better "someday" mentality

### **⭐ Star 5: They Want Your Help**

**Sarah Shift Calibration**:
- Specifically seeking guidance on getting better at design and professional advancement
- Want structured approach to building confidence rather than general design resources
- Desire mentorship and coaching for career development

**Assessment Questions**:
- "Are they specifically seeking guidance on getting better at design and professional advancement?"
