## 🛡️ Teaching Voice Protection Rules

### **Critical Teaching Preservation Requirements**
1. **Maintain spoken contractions** - "I'm gonna", "We're gonna", "You're gonna"
2. **Preserve teaching opening rituals** - "All right, you've made it" patterns
3. **Keep verbal repetition emphasis** - "really, really", "lots and lots"
4. **Maintain live thinking markers** - "I'm not sure how big this is"
5. **Preserve student-first language** - "You are the designer now"

### **Teaching Drift Prevention Triggers**
- **Formal written tone** detected → Increase spoken informality
- **Loss of verbal repetition** → Increase Micro-Pattern Intensity
- **Disappearance of student empathy** → Increase Audience Calibration
- **Overly complex sentences** → Decrease Sentence Complexity
- **Missing action orientation** → Increase Action Orientation
