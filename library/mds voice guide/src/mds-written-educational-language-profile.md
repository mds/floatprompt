# 📝 MDS Written Educational Language Profile

**Archaeological Extraction: Written Curriculum Structure, Vocabulary, and Educational Documentation Rhythm**

> **Extracted from Shift Nudge written curriculum analyzing 200+ educational documentation samples across systematic UI/UX instruction**

## 🔤 Written Educational Sentence Structure Patterns

### **Systematic Concept Introduction**
Structured curriculum opening with clear educational framing:

*"From this point forward, I want you to think of every single piece of interface as a box with a left edge, a right edge, top edge and a bottom edge."*

*"Grids are perhaps one of the most important things when it comes to layout for screen design."*

*"Implicit grid this is probably one of the most important lessons in this entire course, implicit grid."*

*"All right, in this one we're gonna be talking about scale, weight, and hierarchy."*

*"Affordance is the quality or property of an object that defines its possible uses or makes clear how it can or should be used."*

### **Educational Declarative Statements**
Clear, authoritative curriculum delivery:

*"And this is really non-negotiable. From now on everything, and I mean everything that you design is a box."*

*"Why do I want you to do this? Because it's gonna make your life a million times easier as an interface designer."*

*"The trifecta of beautiful design is good typography, good negative space, and good alignment."*

*"Negative space is design oxygen. Without it, your designs will die."*

*"And this is really non-negotiable."*

### **Step-by-Step Documentation Structure**
Systematic curriculum progression with numbered sequences:

*"So there's eight steps that I have come up with that are the overarching elements of my design process. So number one is understanding the problem. Number two is determining the complexity"*

*"So some of the design tool deciding factors, number one is gonna be the team."*

*"So the rule is this, 'Limit yourself to a maximum of four type sizes or less.' Can you break this rule? Yes. Can you use less than four type sizes? Yes."*

## 📚 Educational Documentation Vocabulary

### **Student-Directed Systematic Language**
Clear instructional progression with embedded reasoning:

*"I want you to think of every single piece of interface as a box"*

*"I want this to be every string of text, every folder that contains multiple elements"*

*"From this point forward, I want you to think of"*

*"I feel like this is almost like the inner formula for making interface design work"*

*"I like to hang out in the low to medium density ballpark"*

### **Technical Concept Documentation**
Systematic explanation with clear educational scaffolding:

*"So what is the box model? Well, it's really made up of multiple parts. You have the content, you have padding. You also have a border, which I not showing here and then you have margin."*

*"So what is high density versus low density? Well put extremely simply, high density would mean that things are compact and tight."*

*"Now even if you have a perfect grid and everything is 24 pixels spaced evenly, perfectly, in an interface you're gonna have a lot of irregular shapes"*

### **Educational Authority Assertions**
Confident curriculum guidance with experience-based reasoning:

*"It's not that common where I need to go very tight, very dense, very compact in the high density world."*

*"I feel like this is almost like the inner formula for making interface design work."*

*"I have been using this for a very long time. And it just it's like the glue that holds everything together."*

*"This is definitely the secret sauce for making sure the interface components are nice and aligned."*

## 🎵 Written Educational Rhythm and Flow Patterns

### **Curriculum Building Blocks**
Systematic concept development with logical progression:

*"So in this example, we have a string of text. And in the box model, everything kind of starts at the core and expands out."*

*"So if we added zero padding to the container you can see that now we even though we have two boxes, they're right on top of each other."*

*"So once you kinda get the hang of thinking of things this way, it'll make a lot more sense."*

### **Educational Reinforcement Patterns**
Repeated curriculum emphasis for learning retention:

*"And I use this very I would say 90% in kind of like a rigid context."*

*"But I don't think of that as breaking the grid. I just think of it as like a 2.5 version of the four pixels."*

*"And I have been using this for a very long time."*

*"So I use this implicit grid for almost well not even almost every single element on the page"*

### **Written Explanation Elaboration**
Detailed curriculum exposition with supporting examples:

*"This is gonna help with different screen size design, responsive web design, mobile design, you know things that are stretchy. Think of it as every piece of content is kind of the the source of truth and then it expands out from there."*

*"So padding would be, if I was wearing a big puffy jacket that would be padding. But the margin would be between the padding and the wall."*

## 🔗 Educational Documentation Connectors

### **Systematic Progression Markers**
Clear curriculum sequencing and logical flow:

*"So let's take a look at these examples of the implicit grid in action."*

*"So let's take a look at an actual example of an actual project."*

*"Let's take a look at a few different examples."*

*"Moving on to another example."*

*"Next up, I wanna look at a couple different designers"*

### **Concept Building Transitions**
Educational scaffolding with systematic development:

*"Now I wanna stress that I don't design this way from the very beginning."*

*"So once you have a good design, then you can kind of abstract those into the different pieces"*

*"All right, so now we're gonna dig into some quick examples here."*

*"So before we really get started, I wanna tell you the secret"*

### **Educational Emphasis Bridges**
Curriculum reinforcement with systematic importance:

*"And this is really non-negotiable."*

*"This is probably one of the most important lessons in this entire course"*

*"This is definitely the secret sauce"*

*"This is gonna be very important when you're trying to influence a user"*

## 📱 Written Educational Documentation Fingerprints

### **Curriculum Methodology Explanation**
Systematic process documentation:

*"So I take a number, in my case four pixels and I use that as like the baseline grid measurement for everything in the entire app."*

*"So four pixels, or eight pixels, or 12, or 16, or 20, and so on and so forth in multiples of four."*

*"And I use this very I would say 90% in kind of like a rigid context."*

### **Educational Project Integration**
Real-world application within curriculum structure:

*"So let's take a look at an actual example of an actual project. So I've shown this project before. This is called Cinesampler."*

*"So if we look at more of these examples, you can see that this particular component here, it has its title and the number"*

*"So if you look over here at the list here, you can see that I've got all of these are their individual components."*

### **Student Assignment Documentation**
Clear homework specification with systematic requirements:

*"All right so for homework for the implicit grid I want you to design either an app for like an audio book layout that has a title with a status bar maybe a profile icon and an avatar"*

*"But the big thing to do is design one of these screens and just obsess over four pixels eight pixels 12,16."*

*"So for homework, I want you to come up with some kind of form concept that is kind of in the ballpark of this camera form"*

## 🎭 Written Educational Voice Personality Indicators

### **Curriculum Authority Markers**
Confident educational guidance with systematic backing:

*"I feel like this is almost like the inner formula for making interface design work"*

*"This is definitely the secret sauce for making sure the interface components are nice and aligned"*

*"I have been using this for a very long time"*

*"after more than a decade, this is the folder structure of all folder structures"*

### **Educational Encouragement Integration**
Student support within systematic instruction:

*"And I can't wait for you to get started"*

*"So I can't wait to see what you come up with"*

*"Let's get started on this homework"*

*"Good luck with the project, and I can't wait to see what you post"*

### **Systematic Learning Confidence**
Educational progression with systematic validation:

*"So once you kinda get the hang of thinking of things this way, it'll make a lot more sense"*

*"But I assure you if you can adopt this mindset of using this implicit grid it's gonna make your life so much easier"*

*"And so it's just kind of the underlying role that I use for every single design"*

## 🎯 Written vs. Spoken Educational Differences

### **Documentation vs. Conversation Structure**
Higher formality and systematic organization in written form:

*Written*: "From this point forward, I want you to think of every single piece of interface as a box"
*Spoken*: "All right, you've made it. Welcome to the course."

### **Systematic vs. Adaptive Explanation**
Written follows rigid curriculum structure vs. spoken adaptive flow:

*Written*: "So there's eight steps that I have come up with that are the overarching elements"
*Spoken*: "So before we really get started, I wanna tell you the secret"

### **Educational Authority vs. Conversational Warmth**
Written maintains systematic authority, spoken includes personal connection:

*Written*: "And this is really non-negotiable"
*Spoken*: "I am super excited to have you here"

### **Complete Explanations vs. Real-Time Thinking**
Written provides polished systematic explanations vs. spoken shows live process:

*Written*: Comprehensive concept explanations with full context
*Spoken*: "I'm not sure how big this is. Maybe a hundred points"
