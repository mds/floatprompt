VIRALISH_SUMMARY.TXT

SOURCE
------------------------
This summary is based on the combined reference from Viralish: 7 Elements of the Perfect Hook, Engagement Tactics, and Good Video Checklist.

This is a high-performance storytelling system designed for short-form video formats like Reels, TikTok, and Shorts. It’s used here to inform content structure inside MDS ContentOS—but *not* to overwrite the MDS tone.

Use this file to extract structure, pacing, and retention tactics—without importing exaggeration or hype.

USE THIS FOR
------------------------
• Building short-form video hooks that grab attention  
• Pacing “before → tension → clarity” stories  
• Creating visual storyboards for critiques  
• Driving curiosity without clickbait  
• Applying suspense ladder without losing trust

CORE STRUCTURE (VIRALISH FORMAT)
------------------------
1. **Hook / Itch** – Start with something unexpected, visual, or emotionally disruptive  
2. **Curiosity Gap** – Tease the outcome, make the viewer *want* to stay  
3. **Start in the Action** – Never introduce what you’re going to say—just do it  
4. **No Backstory** – Eliminate setup. Start on the interesting part.  
5. **Clarity, Not Chaos** – Confuse = lose. Every frame must be understandable in isolation.  
6. **Relatability** – Reference trends, friction points, shared user struggles  
7. **Visual Storytelling** – No sound needed. Bold framing, tight animation logic, crisp before/after

CTA TACTICS THAT WORK (WITHOUT FEELING HYPE)
------------------------
• “Tag a friend who needs to see this”  
• “Follow for more UI breakdowns”  
• “This felt small—but changed everything…”  
• “Comment ‘Checklist’ and I’ll DM the system”  
• “Want the full teardown? Link in bio.”  
• “This is one of 3 spacing rules I use every day.”

SOFTENING FOR MDS TONE
------------------------
Many Viralish tactics are aggressive, ironic, or performative. The MDS voice never breaks trust.  
So:

✅ Use:
• Hook → build → reveal → insight  
• Visual before/after clarity  
• Emotional tension from friction, not theatrics  
• Simple CTA with teaching payoff

❌ Avoid:
• Intentionally wrong tools  
• Clickbait intros  
• Mispronounced words  
• Absurd background distractions  
• Hype transitions like “This one trick…” or “Massive layout fail”

MDS-FRIENDLY VIRALISH TRANSLATION
------------------------
| Viralish Tactic | MDS Version |
|------------------|-------------|
| “This ruined everything” | “This layout looks clean—but it’s broken.” |
| “Watch what happens when…” | “Let’s look at what shifts when we fix the spacing.” |
| “Crazy button placement” | “This button adds friction without earning attention.” |
| “Top 3 tricks” | “Here’s one small shift with a huge payoff.” |

PRINCIPLES TO CARRY FORWARD
------------------------
• Build tension through UI friction or visual imbalance  
• Pay it off with clarity, not hype  
• Keep things looping clean: intro matches outro  
• Let edits follow rhythm—every second earns its space  
• Default to calm insight, not energetic surprise

This summary is your bridge from Viralish storytelling to MDS clarity-driven content. Use it when scripting or editing any short-form material to ensure high retention without tone drift.

ONE_PEAK_SUMMARY.TXT

SOURCE
------------------------
This summary is based on the full One Peak Creative Content Guide, including their viral checklists, hook writing process, platform playbooks, and motivational frameworks.

It is intended as a supplemental system to Viralish—more practical, less aggressive—and highly optimized for organic TikTok and Reels discovery. Use this when you want real-world language, format-specific examples, or platform-tested advice.

USE THIS FOR
------------------------
• Hook writing structure for TikTok and Reels
• Punchy openers that convert on vertical video
• Structuring videos with payoff pacing
• Checking the One Peak 6-point “Viral Video” checklist
• Motivational content or behind-the-scenes newsletter writing

ONE PEAK VIDEO STRUCTURE (3-Part Format)
------------------------
1. **Hook (0–5s)**  
   - Most important part. Must grab attention immediately.
   - Clarity + Curiosity + Context = engagement

2. **Value (5–25s)**  
   - Every second must earn its place. Cut the lulls.
   - Layer voice, text, visuals, and motion

3. **Payoff (final 5s)**  
   - Deliver the transformation, reaction, insight, or punchline
   - Never resolve too early or retention drops

VIRAL VIDEO CHECKLIST (Use for Final QA)
------------------------
✅ Hooked viewer in first 5s  
✅ Used relatability or familiar story pattern  
✅ Made it shareable by niche/topic/timing  
✅ Repeatable format for future content  
✅ Cut every lull or slow section  
✅ Clear payoff at the end

HOOK FRAMEWORKS (FROM ONE PEAK)
------------------------
• This [X] changed everything  
• Don’t make this mistake...  
• You’re doing [X] wrong  
• Here’s why nobody talks about [X]  
• 3 things [X] creators never do  
• I tried [X] so you don’t have to  
• Instead of [popular idea] do this  
• The lazy way to [desirable result]  
• I filmed my [spouse/friend/team] doing [X] and this happened…

HOOK FORMULA = 
  (Relatable character) + (Curious situation) + (Tease of outcome)

DELIVERY MODES
------------------------
• Voice (must begin instantly, no intros)
• On-screen text (clear, linger 3–5s)
• Captions (tease outcome or “you won’t believe…”)
→ Best performance = use all 3 formats

HOOK WRITING METHOD (SYNTHESIZED)
------------------------
1. Start with your **payoff** in mind  
2. Write 5 alternate hook options  
3. Apply 3 C’s = Clarity, Context, Curiosity  
4. Refine. Remove fluff. One extra word ruins it.  
5. Deliver using voice/text/caption. Preferably all.

RELATABILITY + SHAREABILITY TACTICS
------------------------
• Use niche lingo, frustrations, or situations  
• Speak directly to one person or tribe  
• Show something familiar with a twist  
• Reference products, tools, or workflows people already know  
• Create something that people will tag a friend in

REPEATABILITY FRAMEWORK
------------------------
• Identify repeatable format (e.g. layout teardown, redesign, challenge)
• Change variable: screen type, device, context
• Repeat what worked with light remix
• Use past high performers as future templates

TONE + STYLE WARNINGS
------------------------
Avoid:  
• Hype language like “massive hack”  
• Shaky intros or long-winded setup  
• Listicle phrasing or too many emojis  
• Explaining too much up front  
• High-production tone that sounds too polished

Favor:  
• Calm precision  
• Bold visuals  
• Conversational clarity  
• Hook-to-payoff rhythm  
• Value in every frame

MOTIVATION + MINDSET FRAMEWORK (OPTIONAL)
------------------------
The final section of the One Peak guide includes motivational prompts and reframes. Use this for:

• Behind-the-scenes newsletter writing  
• Founder reflections  
• CTA writing with authenticity  
• Narratives that explore imposter syndrome, creative risk, or long-game thinking

EXAMPLES:
• “I used to think more effort = better design. Then I saw what simplicity can actually do.”  
• “I used to believe clean = good. But sometimes clarity requires tension.”

SUMMARY
