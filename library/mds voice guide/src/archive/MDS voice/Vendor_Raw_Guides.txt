7 Elements of the Perfect Hook
------------------------------------------------

1. Create an Itch
	- Combine two things that don't usually go together

2. Curiosity Gap
	- Anchor the storyline to keep the viewer hooked through the big reveal

3. Start in the Action
	- Don't explain what you're going to do, JUST DO IT!
		A. Anchor
		B. Reveal

		Niche Examples
			- Cooking Videos
			- DIYs
			- Life Hacks
			- Expert Advice
			- Unboxing Videos
			- NEVER SAY "Hey guys, today I'm going to show you.."

4. Zero Backstory
	- How will you "un-niche" your hook?
	- Opening Shot (START WITH THIS)

5. Zero Chaos
	- Keep the viewer curious, never confused
	- LOOK!

6. Relatability
	- Ideas for connecting with viewers and improving engagement
	- Common Themes
	- Shared Experiences
	- Trending in the Media
	- Popular Products

7. Visual Storytelling
	- The hook must be understandable without sound:
	- Audio has captions or text
	- Shot fills the frame
	- Bright or contrasting colors
	- Good lighting

Engagement Tactics
---------------------------
- Wear something “unique” but never call attention to it.
- Unzip your fly
- Intentionally mispronounce something
- Disagree on camera ask the audience to settle the debate
- Place something absurd in the background of your video
- Wear a controversial shirt
- Intentionally use a tool or utensil wrong

“The world needs to see this”
“Tell us your favorite...”
“He deserves a raise”

HOW TO MAKE A GOOD VIDEO
------------------------

CHECKLIST FOR CREATORS
-----------------------

BEFORE YOU TURN ON THE CAMERA
------------------------------
- KEEP YOUR CONCEPT SIMPLE
  Make it simple enough that a five-year-old could understand.

  Good, simple premises:
  - My child is a demon!
  - How to clean your toilet
  - Hack to double your $$$!
  - My grandpa needs my kidney!
  - Wine Pie
  - There’s a family of raccoons in the bushes!

  Bad, overly-complex premises:
  - Grandpa doesn’t realize the surprise next door!
  - Revenge on my husband's prank!
  - Nobody liked him, until she came around.

- SHOW US SOMETHING UNIQUE, SURPRISING OR SHOCKING
  - Pour tequila into a coffee pot
  - Drop a $100 bill into sizzling oil
  - Cut a bike in half
  - “Show, don’t tell.” Let’s SEE something happen

- SET UP GOOD LIGHTING
  Face the subject, avoid harsh shadows, backlight, and reflections

- CHOOSE A SIMPLE BACKGROUND
  Avoid clutter. Make your subject ‘pop’

THE FIRST SECOND OF THE VIDEO
-----------------------------
- BEGIN WITH A SIMPLE SHOT
  One person or close-up of two objects max

- FILL UP THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE FRAME
  Put key visuals dead center. Avoid top/bottom edge.

- START IN ON THE ACTION
  Let the action begin as the video starts. Use slow, noticeable movement

- DON’T MOVE THE CAMERA
  Keep it still for comprehension. Zoom or pan only if slow and necessary

THE FIRST 15 SECONDS OF YOUR VIDEO
----------------------------------
- SEAMLESSLY FLOW INTO THE SECOND ACTION OR PLOT POINT
  Add new info to same frame, don’t swing camera away

- MAKE IT CLEAR WHERE YOUR VIDEO IS ‘GOING’
  Audience should know what they’re watching and what they’re waiting for

- ESTABLISH HIGH STAKES
  Make viewers care. Use high-impact, relatable stakes

DURING YOUR VIDEO
-----------------
- LEAD UP TO ONE BIG MOMENT
  Build toward an emotional payoff or visual reveal

- ADD EMOTIONS
  Use fear, anger, joy, admiration, awe

- STEADILY MOVE TOWARDS THE VIDEO’S MAIN OBJECTIVE
  No distractions. Mini-payoffs help

- GIVE PEOPLE AT LEAST THREE THINGS TO COMMENT ON
  - Appearance
  - Unique props
  - Moral dilemmas

PUBLISHING YOUR VIDEO
----------------------
- CREATE A CAPTION IN LINE WITH FACEBOOK’S NEW WATCHBAIT GUIDELINES
  - No ALL CAPS
  - No ellipses...
  - One emoji max
  - No “You won’t believe!”
  - No double !!
  - No “You have to see...”
  - Avoid “this...” and “when...”

  Instead, be direct:
  - Funny dog finds green ball!
  - Child steals from grandma’s purse and gets caught!

- PICK A GOOD THUMBNAIL
  Clear, well-lit, relevant to video

- PICK A TITLE THAT WILL NOT TRIGGER ‘EXTRA VIDEO REVIEW’
  Avoid mentions of protected classes or controversy

RULES TO LIVE BY
----------------
- FOLLOW ALL COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND MONETIZATION GUIDELINES
  Violations can demonetize your page for months

- DON’T GET US SUED
  - Don’t defame businesses
  - Don’t fake harmful stunts
  - Don’t impersonate brands
  - Don’t violate privacy
  - Don’t do anything dangerous

The Creator Roadmap
-------------------

How to turn your hobby into a full time job as a content creator!

Index
-----

* Finding Your Passion
* Research Phase
* Creating Your TikTok
* Making Content
* Free Samples!
* Getting Paid
* QUIT YOUR DAY JOB

"There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living" -Nelson Mandela

Step 1 - Finding Your Passion
------------------------------

Action: Write 3 answers to the questions on this list

* What do I like doing when I'm not at work?
* What are my favourite hobbies?
* When do I truly feel most alive?
* What days am I most excited to get out of bed?

Once you've written out these answers, find the common denominator - that is your passion.

Living in your passion, or 'your fire' can often feel like an irresponsible endeavour - but I want you to shift your perspective. Allow yourself to imagine how you would feel if you got to do what you loved most each day? How would that energy affect the people around you? When you live in your fire, you're leading by example - and empowering others to do the same.

It's better to live a life filled with passion than a half-hearted attempt at righteousness - We only live once, so why not live on fire?

Step 2 - Create a New TikTok Account
------------------------------------

Action: Create a brand new TikTok that will be used SPECIFICALLY for your passion. When doing this, take time to be very intentional with the following information:

Username - When choosing your name, try your best to think of something that's going to be easy to remember, but also helps describe your passion. For example - my real name is Conar Fair, but I saw an opportunity to immediately connect my name to golf by making my username 'Conar Fairway'. This has been extremely helpful for growing a recognizable personal brand.

Bio - When writing your bio, try to concisely inform your audience exactly what they can expect from your page. Your bio can be a hook in and of itself - and often times it's a big catalyst in getting new followers!

Profile Picture - Similarly to the points above; your profile pic is what people are going to see when you leave comments, engage with posts, and on your profile page. It's important to have a photo that fits your passion!

Once your profile is set-up, it's time to start training the algorithm and finding inspiration! That leads us to the next step of our guide!

Step 3 - Research Phase
-----------------------

"Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose." - Zora Neale Hurston

Action: Find and follow 3 people in the field you're passionate about. Ideally -these people should be getting consistent engagement and viewership.

To do this try searching your passion on TikTok. We'll use Golfing as an example:

TikTok Search: 'Golf videos'

Immediately I'm introduced to 4 unique content creators. Each of these creators offer their own unique value. One does trick shots, another does skits, and one does challenge videos.

Find and follow the creators who inspire you, and start to note what they're doing well - and how you could create your own similar value in the space!

Step 4 - Making Content
-----------------------

"You cant use up creativity. The more you use. The more you have." -Maya Angelou

Action: Create your first 10 videos

After completing the course, use the knowledge you've gained and start recording yourself doing your hobby. Make creating content a priority and get comfortable being on camera. Here are a few formats as thought starters to get you going:

* Challenges - How can you create a challenge around your passion? Are there unique stakes you can include?
* Skits - What makes your passion relatable? Try re-enacting a funny moment you've encountered.
* Story - Tell the story of how you got into your passion - or the craziest memory you have while doing it.

Once you've created your first 10 videos - you're ready to start posting!

BONUS TIP - Posting videos to TikTok requires a bit of a strategy ie -what hashtags to use, when to post, how to title etc. Check out page 10 in our "Viral TikTok Checklist" to make sure you've hit all of these steps!

Step 5 - Free Samples
----------------------

Action: Create a 'FREE' video for a local business in your niche.

Now that you've began posting videos and building an audience - you can use your TikTok account as a proof of concept to find brand partners who are on TikTok. Start small by creating video content for local companies. Although you won't be getting paid to create these videos, you should be able to exchange the post for their services or products.

EXAMPLE: When I first started my golf TikTok - I made a video trying out a local Golf Simulator. The owner saw the video and ended up offering me a $500 gift card to make another video!

This FREE video made me $500!

Pro Tip: When you upload these videos - make sure you tag the brand so theres a higher chance of them seeing your post!

Step 6 - Getting Paid
----------------------

Action: Send your first pitch!

Now that you have a proven track record and portfolio - it's time to GET PAID TO CREATE! This is your opportunity to reach out to brands you could see yourself integrating into your content in a way that feels genuine.

There are THOUSANDS of brands who have affiliate marketing programs and are constantly on the lookout for creators to help market their products. There's also a good chance that at this point you may have already had some Influencer Marketing Specialists reach out to you on their brands behalf!

Most of these will be smaller opportunities to start - likely around $50 -$500 per post. But as you continue to grow your audience - the opportunities will continue to grow with it! (So far I've been offered up to $3500 for one single video - and right now I only have 40k followers!)

When you reach out to these companies via DM or Email - it's important to have a consolidated pitch. We call this an Electronic Pitch Deck or and EPK for short. We've created a template you can use to enter all of your info and attached it for you below.

Step 7 - Quit Your Day Job
---------------------------

Action: QUIT YOUR DAY JOB

Doing it once is the hardest part. Now that you've had your first ever paid client, you have an understanding of what it takes. Repeat the process and work towards growing your rate until you're willing to take the final step - quitting your job.

This step looks different for everyone - and may not ever even be necessary for you if you're happy with just getting free products and creating content as a hobby. But at this point - you have everything you need to build your dream life as a creator!

Mindset Bonus Lesson Workbook
------------------------------

What is it that creates the gap from good to great - and great to world class?

Is it strength, skill or knowledge? Maybe.

Or maybe it's something less "visible". It's the same force, the same intelligence that helped:

* Edison create over 1,000 patents
* Roger Bannister run a mile in under 4 minutes; a feat previously deemed "humanly impossible"
* The Wright Brothers decide that automobiles weren't quite "cool" anymore - that it was time to travel by air

It's not the power of logic, reason, or knowing "how" something is going to come together; it's the power of belief.

Belief is what's holding you stuck, it's also what's going to catapult you to places you've never seen before. The ability to believe in the unseen, to bring an idea from thought, to action, to finished product, this is the secret sauce.

If you've been stuck, lacking vision, or just needing a little "nudge" forward - this bonus lesson could be precisely what

The Year of Your Life
---------------------

You can't hit a target you cannot see, so following the short visualization exercise in the video lesson, answer a few of the following questions from the perspective of looking back at your best year yet:

* The "Year of my Life" looks like…
* I'm serving the world by…
* The place I'm living is…
* The freedom in my life allows me to...
* The top 3 emotions I live by are...
* The balance in my bank account(s) looks like…
* 3 action I can take right now to make this come to life…

See, a lot of the time we look for the "next step" instead of the "finished product". Because your subconscious mind doesn't know the difference between "real" and "imagined", it is far easier to give it the blueprint of the end result instead of finding the next step to take.

Thinking from the end, as referred to in Stephen Covey's book The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People, is the secret to bringing your dreams to life.

When you ask a powerful question like "how could I triple my income while working half the time?", that genius part of your brain is forced to create a picture on the screen of your mind.

From there, it is time to take immediate action before your brain does its best to talk you out of it (and it will).

Exposing Beliefs
----------------

A belief is a thought we have thought over and over again, for long enough, that it's become "unquestionable and absolute truth" to us.

Beliefs are what drive our behaviour, but we cannot change what we are not aware of.

Right now, you have unconscious beliefs that are running your show, and you don't even know about them yet!

Crazy… right?

But here's the good news:

As Louise Hay says - a belief is just a thought and a thought can be changed.

So start by completing the following questions before your brain has any time whatsoever to analyze them…

* Money is the root of all ___________________
* Time is ______________
* Working ________ is the key to success
* Successful people are ____________
* The one thing that's actually holding me back from achieving everything I want is ____________________
* The reason I procrastinate is because I'm scared of __________________
* If I really "made it", people close to me would think I am ___________________
* I'm scared that going viral on the internet would mean __________________

If you answered some questions and immediately thought: "where on earth did that come from?"

That's a good thing!

This is a powerful exercise to expose how you really feel about success, money, and being "seen"

Creating New Beliefs
--------------------

"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will continue to rule your life and you will call it fate" - Carl Jung

This is your last prompt, but it could be the one you need most.

Just like you can write over an audio track with another one to erase the first, you can absolutely overwrite old beliefs by consciously choosing new ones.

This will take time, as research has shown it takes anywhere from 21 to 67 days to create a new "synapsis" in your brain in which new habits or beliefs become "automatic".

But that's okay, because anytime you start to fall back into old habits, you can "catch" yourself by saying "there I was, going unconscious and defaulting to my old patterns, thank you brain!"

Go easy on yourself, be gracious in the process of transformation, and celebrate small wins along the way.

Close out this worksheet by naming 3+ old, limiting beliefs while consciously choosing 3+ new, opposite beliefs.

For example:
"Money is hard to make" → "Money comes to me easily"

Use the table below to complete this exercise

Old Belief | New Belief
-----------|------------
          |
          |

Your Next Steps
---------------

Congratulations! 🎉

You've made a lot of progress in just this short exercise alone. It can be challenging looking at longstanding ways of thinking, doing and being; but it's the deep work that leads to lasting transformation.

Your belief in yourself is the secret weapon that will carry you through your most challenging times.

It's also the "one thing" that could be missing from your life right now, and I hope this short time we spent together today helped put some pieces of the puzzle together for you.

Or better yet, make you decide you're throwing the old puzzle in the garbage because it wasn't the one you wanted to build anyways, and starting from scratch.

Whatever it is, I'm in your corner, and that's why I have a really special invitation for you.

"We believe that hook writing is the number one skill you can learn as a content creator."

Hey Friend!!

Since you scooped up this guide, chances are you are probably struggling with creating compelling video hooks. Or maybe the entire concept of 'hooks' and why they are essential to include in every single video you post is uncharted territory to you.

Take a deep breath and know that you are not alone. Hook writing is the number one step of the creative process we get asked about most. And that's because it's the most important skill you can learn as a content creator.

Without a strong hook at the beginning of your video, nobody is going to know why content is worth their time. Forget to include a hook.. and that video you spent a ton of time making will unfortunately end up in 'flop land'.

This guide will walk you through our step-by-step hook writing process that helped us go from 500 to 500,000 average views.

Let's be honest, we've all had those moments where 'throwing in the towel' feels like the easier option. So that's why we're pulling back the curtain and sharing our proven process so you can quickly become a more confident hook writer!

This guide will walk you through the three different kinds of hooks to be aware of, how to write hooks for your specific niche & provide over 50 examples you can start trying today! It's time to make your short form videos stand out among the rest and finally get you those views you've been dreaming of.

We can't wait for you to get started!!

What is a Hook?
---------------

"A 'hook' is a statement (either spoken or written) that provides context to the viewer of what your video is going to be about."

Every hook you write should:

* Be 3-5 SECONDS long (to avoid the viewer scrolling away)
* Spark CURIOSITY for the viewer to watch until the end
* Be CLEAR and EASY to understand
* Determine the VALUE of the video

Think of the hook as the most important element of your video. Without it, the viewer doesn't have any idea why they are watching in the first place (which will ultimately result in them scrolling away). Lead with a strong hook.. you give them a reason to believe your content is worth their valuable time.

Activity: Create a note in your phone with this 4-step checklist that you can reference every time you go to write a hook for your videos.

Why Include a Hook?
-------------------

Forgetting to begin your video with a strong hook is the number one mistake we see creators make on TikTok + Instagram..

A great hook is what is going to take the watch time on your video content to soaring new heights! And in case you didn't know, watch time is the NUMBER ONE metric you should be keeping tabs on while measuring your content's success. If you can't capture your viewer's attention right off the bat, they won't be compelled to stick around to hear the rest of your story or offer. This will make them miss out on the value you are trying to provide, but will also tank your watch time in the process.

Here's 3 ways hooks improve your video's performance:

PROVIDING CONTEXT - Truth bomb: assume nobody knows or cares who you are. We know this might sound harsh, but stay with us. With how fast pace the content world is moving, the reality is that you will be fighting for people's attention on TikTok and Instagram. Providing clarity in your hook is going to help justify why YOUR content is worth stopping the scroll for. It should offer context to what the video is about, who is involved and where the story is going (the payoff).

ENCOURAGING RETENTION - Think of the first 3-5 seconds of your video as your only shot to convince people your video is worth sticking around until the end for (remember, watch time is key). If they aren't intrigued or entertained, they'll scroll onto something better. Hooks and secondary hooks (which we will get into later) will help keep your video engaging for your viewer as they continue to watch.

SPARKING CURIOSITY - Humans are naturally curious, so use this knowledge to your advantage. Your hook should be so intriguing that the viewer simply has to stick around to see how it resolves. The longer they stick around... the more the algorithm will reward you.

3 Ways to Deliver a Hook
------------------------

In order for your hook to be effective, it needs to be delivered with as much clarity as possible.

There are three ways you can present a hook to your audience: by speaking directly to camera, writing it in a text block or including it in your video's caption. Deciding how you deliver your hook is going to come down to the style of content you are creating.. BUT the best case scenario is if you can use all three at the same time!

1. Speaking to Camera (Vocal)
-----------------------------

This is the most common way to deliver a hook but also where we see the most mistakes made. Your hook needs to start as soon as the video starts (not 2 seconds in). Do not lead your hook with.. "Hey! My name is XX and today..". Just get straight into it and make sure it doesn't exceed more than 3-5 seconds.

VOCAL HOOK EXAMPLE:
"Apparently jackfruit can look and taste like pulled pork, so I'm going to try and trick my husband." Audiences immediately know who is involved, the theme of the video & that they should expect a reaction at the end.

2. Text Blocks
--------------

If it doesn't make sense for your video to begin with you speaking to camera or with a voiceover, you can still include a hook by using a text block. Sometimes, text blocks can also be a great way to further clarify your hook OR offer a secondary hook to what you are saying as well. Make sure it lingers long enough on the screen (at least 3 seconds) so the viewer can read the entire thing.

TEXT HOOK EXAMPLE:
"Making my wife PB&J Spaghetti" Since this isn't a 'normal' food combination, this hook sparks curiosity in the viewer and hints that a reaction is coming. If we hadn't added the text block, the viewer wouldn't have known why it was worth sticking around to the end of the video or had any context of where the story was going.

3. The Video's Caption
----------------------

Think of your video's caption as PRIME HOOK REAL ESTATE! This is your 'hail mary' opportunity to intrigue the viewer to watch your full video. This is not a spot to just add some extra fluff or a cute quote (we see this mistake a lot). Your caption should hint at what's to come and further spark curiosity as to how the video is going to resolve (example: "I can't believe her face when she took the first bite!").

CAPTION HOOK EXAMPLE:
"It's that drive on the back 9 that's going to keep me coming back." This statement sparks curiosity of what drive he is referring to and encourages the viewer to watch until the end of the video.

Elements of a Good Hook
-----------------------

But what should I include in my hook?

A good hook should always include what we like to call The Three C's:
Clarity, Context & Curiosity.

CLARITY - Your hook should always indicate what VALUE viewer can expect to get out of the video, so then they can decide if it's worth their time. Are you sharing a new beauty hack? Trying to get a funny reaction out of someone? Showcasing a golf swing tip? Your hook should clarify what the theme of the video is and you need to make sure it is easy for people to understand.

CONTEXT - Again, if your goal is to create a viral video, you need to assume the viewer has no idea of 'who' is involved or 'what' is going to happen. That context needs to be presented in your hook.. otherwise, they are scrolling in the first 5 seconds. Example: If your video is themed around pranking your husband, make sure you include that context in your hook. Otherwise, the viewer is just watching you do something weird with a random dude and doesn't understand your relationship to them.

CURIOSITY - Your hook always needs to spark curiosity in the viewer. It should raise a question or hint that a reaction or result is coming. The viewer should feel a NEED to know how your hook resolves.

Here's a closer look at clarity, context and curiosity in action.

Example:
"My wife has been telling me that she can eat an entire watermelon in one sitting."

(context) (clarity) (curiosity)

In the first 5 seconds, this hook gives context (who is in the video and what is going on), provides clarity of the value (this will be a funny video about a woman trying to eat an entire watermelon) and sparks curiosity (will she be able to accomplish it in one sitting?).

Activity: Go back through the last 10 videos you posted to TikTok or Reels + determine what you could have done to improve (or include) a hook!

Our Hook Writing Process
------------------------

But what's the process to start writing better hooks?

Taking everything we've learned so far, now it's time to walk through our step-by-step hook writing process! Nailing down this skill is the most valuable thing you can master as a content creator. It really is a secret weapon. It might feel hard at first but practice makes perfect. Take as much time as you need to make sure your video's hook is as strong as it can be - every. single. time.

The Hook Writing Roadmap
------------------------

STEP 1: Start with the end in mind - What is the result at the end of your video that is worth sticking around to see? That is going to inform your hook. Example: In the PB&J Spaghetti video, we knew people would want to see the reaction of Meg trying this strange meal.

STEP 2: Follow The 3 C's to write your hook - Concisely outline (in 1 sentence or 3-5 seconds) what the viewer should expect from your video while providing clarity, context and sparking curiosity. We always make a list of 5 different ways to phrase our hooks and then do a process of elimination. If you're into using AI in your workflow, you could even try using Chat GPT for this to help you spark ideas.

STEP 3: Refine!! - Once you have chosen your favourite option, take the time to refine your hook until it is as clear as possible. Think: 'Cut the fluff'! One extra or missed word could be the difference of 500 or 500,000 views.

STEP 4: Determine your hook format - Next, choose between a vocal hook, a text block hook or caption (though captions should ALWAYS be included no matter what). If it makes sense to do all three... bonus points!!

STEP 5: Measure Success - 9 times out of 10 a video's success comes down to the hook. We make it a rule of thumb to analyze every single piece of our content 2 days after posting it. If it did well compared to your other videos, think about if there is a way to repeat the concept with a similar hook. And if it did poorly, make it a habit to REWRITE THE HOOK for some extra practice.

It's also great to take a look at your video's 'Retention' insights to see how long people are watching for. If over 50% of people are watching past 5 seconds, you are on the right track!

Click 'More Data' at the bottom of your video. Then scroll to 'Engagement',

Hook Examples
-------------

It's time to get those creative juices flowin'.

To get you started creating great hooks of your own, we've listed some plug & play examples below (which you can adjust as needed to fit your own niche)!

* I bet I can change your mind about XX in 20 seconds
* Seeing if a stranger can beat me at XX
* I just experienced the most (embarrassment/adrenaline) in my life..
* Recording (insert person)'s reaction to XX..
* Last person to do XX gets XX
* This XX tip will save you XX hours
* This (feature) is why I bought XXX
* Seeing if (insert person) can guess if XX is (homemade)
* Instead of using XX like everyone else... I use this instead!
* 3 'XXX' tips I wish I knew earlier (the last one blew my mind)
* The 4 XXX products I can't start my day without
* Loser of (insert challenge) has to XX
* How I made '$3500' in one week doing XXX! 🤯
* Why am I the only one talking about XXX??

The TikTok Channel Setup Guide
------------------------------

A step-by-step roadmap for making sure nothing is missed when setting up your TikTok account.

Follow the steps to success.

TikTok Setup Checklist
----------------------

This is the checklist we suggest all creators review whether they are A) starting a brand new TikTok account or B) wanting to revamp their current channel. These tips will help you optimize your TikTok SEO, enhance your partnership potential and help you monetize your channel.

* Set Up your new account & select a Nickname
* Determine the Type of Account - Business or Creator
* Upload a Profile Picture that suits your niche
* Write a Bio that is compelling & unique
* Create an Email Address to attach to the account
* Change your Username
* Add a Linktree to your Bio
* Start training the Algorithm

Best Practices for Setting Up a New TikTok Account
---------------------------------------------------

Note: If you already have a TikTok account set up, feel free to skip down to Step 4 and onward to make sure your profile is optimized to the best of it's ability!

Step 1: Create or select an Email Address for the account
----------------------------------------------------------

Before creating your TikTok account, its important to put some thought into the email address you want to have associated with it. If you are interested in growing a personal brand on TikTok & landing partnerships, consider setting up a new email address that you use just for TikTok. That way you can keep everything organized and in one place. Bonus points if you can make this new email similar to your desired username (more on that in later steps).If you are planning to us the account for business, and already have an email address associated with your business, you can simply use that to set up your account.

Note: We always suggest using an email that you use or plan to use regularly (not one of the 'junk' emails you use to get coupons and such..lol we all have one). That way no potential opportunities get missed!

Step 2: Create Account + Choose a Nickname
-------------------------------------------

Now it's time to actually create your new TikTok account. Download and open the TikTok App on your phone and use the email you just created to set up your new account. You'll notice that TikTok provides other ways to create an account (ie. Sign up with a phone number, connect with Facebook, ect), but we always suggest using an email address as the process is a lot simpler.

Next you'll be prompted to choose a Nickname. Your nickname is is displayed in various areas in TikTok including the For You feed, Friends Tab, comments, and direct messages. Think of this as the name that will show up to your audience on TikTok. Your nickname should set you apart on the platform and give a hint to your audience as to what type of content you make. Although you can change your nickname every 7 days, we suggest putting some serious thought into it and keeping the same name as you grow your brand.

Once you have created your Nickname, TikTok is going to send you a verification code via email to finish the initial account set up process. Once verified, sign back into the App and continue onto Steps 4 through 10.

Step 3: Verify Your New Account
--------------------------------

How to change your nickname (if you already have an account):

1. In the TikTok app, tap Profile at the bottom.
2. Tap "Edit profile".
3. Tap Name.
4. Enter your desired nickname. You can enter up to 30 characters. Keep in mind, nicknames must adhere to our Community Guidelines.
5. Tap Save.

Step 4: Change Your Username
-----------------------------

A username is the @handle you are going to use to sign into the platform (dont mistake this for the nickname we just set up). You'll notice during the verification process that TikTok has assigned you a random username for the time being. Now that you can access the app with your new account, your first step is going to change that random username to something more on brand. Ideally, you want this to be the same as your Nickname for brand consistency

. Unfortunately, this might not be possible, if it is already taken. So try find something as close as you can - this can be changed every 30 days but we recommend keeping it the same.

Simply click the 'Edit Profile" button and then go into the username section to update. If you see a little green check when you type in your desired username, you are good to go!

How to change your username:

1. In the TikTok app, tap Profile at the bottom.
2. Tap "Edit profile."
3. Go to the "Username"
4. Enter your desired username (if it's available, a green checkmark will appear)
5. Tap Save.

Q: Should my username match on Instagram? A: If you already have a handle on Instagram, consider using the same one on TikTok for consistency (especially if you are wanting to do brand deals). It makes it much less confusing. You could even consider changing your Instagram handle to match your new handle on TikTok if you are wanting to switch it up.

Step 5: Add or Change Your Profile Picture
-------------------------------------------

Your profile picture is a small feature with an opportunity to make a BIG impact. If you can find a creative way to highlight who you are and what you do in a small circle - it can help you stand out from the rest of the crowd and give you an immediately recognizable brand. Do your best to select a photo that is relevent to your niche so people know what to expect from your channel.

How to change your profile picture:

1. In the TikTok app, tap Profile at the bottom.
2. Tap "Edit profile."
3. After clicking "Change photo", select a new picture from your camera roll to change to your profile picture.

Step 6: Writing Your Bio
-------------------------

Writing your bio is like creating an elevator pitch. It's the five seconds or 80 characters you have to let a new audience know why they NEED to follow you. Here is where you should concisely explain what you have to offer - that can be the type on content you create, how frequently you create it, maybe a joke if you're a comedian, or your favourite quote if you make inspirational content. It's also important to ALWAYS include your email in your bio so it's easily visible for brands and any other potential opportunities to find their way to your inbox.

How to add to your bio:

1. In the TikTok app, tap Profile at the bottom.
2. Tap "Edit profile."
3. Click into the "Bio" section and add your

Step 7: Add a Linktree to Your Profile
---------------------------------------

Now that your bio is done - we've got one last piece to add before we get into our final step. Linktree is an app you may already be familiar with but essentially it allows your audience to easily navigate through a list of places you'd like them to visit right there on your TikTok page. Note: A Linktree link can only be added to your TikTok profile once you reach 10,000 followers.

When setting up your links - make sure to create short, and easy to understand titles for your audience - they should clearly communicate the value that can be found by following that link. Some examples are your YouTube channel, a personal or professional website or portfolio, or additional social media links where you have something else to offer them.

Here's what your LinkTree link could look like:

If a viewer clicks the link displayed in your TikTok profile, they will then be taken to this!

Step 8: Determine Your Account Type
------------------------------------

Now you'll have an option to choose between a creator, or a business account. There are a few VERY important details to consider here. The vast majority of the time we recommend using a creator account. This will ensure you have full use of TikTok's audio library and effects. Business accounts are limited to a much smaller library of copyright free audio which could limit your ideas and your growth potential. You should only use a business account if you need access to advanced analytics and business tools like their 'Business Creative Hub or TikTok Ads manager'. We personally believe a creator account is the best option!

How to switch to a business account:

1. In the TikTok app, tap "Profile" at the bottom.
2. Tap the "Menu bar" (the three lines) in the top righthand corner
3. Tap "Settings & Privacy"
4. Tap "Manage Account"
5. Choose "Switch to Business Account"

Step 9: Train the Algorithm
----------------------------

This is kind of a bonus step but it can be extremely helpful in priming the algorithm for the type of content you'll be uploading. Take 15 minutes to search for and consume content in your niche. Find a few pages that you love and give them a follow. Drop some likes comments and saves so TikTok knows that this is an active account interested in a unique type of content. From here - you're set up and ready to START CREATING!

The Anatomy of a Viral Video
-----------------------------

What makes a video go 'viral'?

There are a lot of ways to go viral, but only one we've found that can be easily replicated time and time again.

The Hook (0-5 seconds) - Nothing matters more than the first 5 seconds of your video. You could have created the greatest piece of content in history but if it doesn't grab people's attention in the first five seconds, they've scrolled to the next best thing. More info on creating killer hooks to come!

The Value (15s-2m) - If one second of your video doesn't add value, take it out. Value can be anything from a laugh to a lesson but every second of your video needs to drive viewers towards the video's payoff. Be prepared to ruthlessly cut anything that doesn't make your video better.

The Payoff (last 5 seconds) - Never resolve your video until the final 5 seconds. As soon as people get what they came for (the answer to the hook), they're going to scroll. So wait to give it to them until the last 5 seconds. This could be a reaction, the result of a challenge or the punchline of a joke.

The Viral TikTok Checklist
---------------------------

There's six steps that will give your videos the best chance at going viral.

This is the checklist we run all of our videos through to make sure it has the highest watch time possible. That's because, WATCH TIME is the key insight to determine a video's overall success. We've included a detailed explanation for each line item throughout this guide and why you should be checking each of these boxes EVERY TIME you post a video to TikTok or Reels.

* There's a captivating HOOK in the first 5 seconds
* It uses RELATABILITY to capture viewers' attention
* It's SHAREABLE for a large niche of people
* It's REPEATABLE if/when it blows up
* You've CUT THE LULLS for the best watch time possible
* It has a PAYOFF at the end of the video

1. Hooks
--------

The HOOK is BY FAR the most important part of your video. Without it, no one is going to make it past the first 5 seconds of your video and it will live forever in what we like to call "flop-land".

Similar to the headline of a newspaper, the HOOK is a promise to the viewer that your video is going to be worth watching if they stick around to the end. When you pause your video after the first 5 seconds, do you feel an irresistible urge to continue because you NEED TO KNOW how it ends? If the answer is no, it's time for a rework. The same video, with a slightly different hook can get literally millions more views. Your hook needs to be clear, concise and leave the viewer needing to get to the end. For inspiration, go through websites like Buzzfeed and pay attention to what you feel an urge to click on. Chances are, that same format can be reworked to fit your own videos.

3 Types of Hooks
----------------

TikTok + Instagram combine visuals with audio and text, so there are a million ways to grab people's attention. The best content on the platforms, combine all three to create a hook so engaging, you couldn't scroll past it if you wanted to. I'll break them down here:

VISUAL: Is the first 5 seconds of your video bright, quick paced, and interesting to look at? Note: Faces statistically grab people's attention better than objects.

AUDIO: If you are speaking to camera to deliver a hook (or doing a voiceover) it needs to needs to be crystal clear and easy to understand. Make sure your voice audio isn't competing with the music you have selected.

TEXT: Text is a secret weapon. You can write your hook in text, providing context to everything else happening in the video. Often a long text block with a good hook gets high views because it takes 15 seconds to read.

2. Cut the Lulls
----------------

Okay, so you have people captivated after the first 5 seconds with a killer hook. Now, you need to keep it that way. There can't be a single moment of lull in your video. If there is, your viewer is scrolling. The story has to be constantly moving forward and anything that doesn't drive you towards the payoff needs to go.

So how do you do that?

TRIM THE DIALOGUE - Make sure every sentence in the video leads people to the payoff at the end. Remove any unnecessary pauses or space in the story.

ADD TEXT - Adding quick moving subtitles can dial in attention and avoid any words being missed. As a bonus, this also makes the content enjoyable to people with their sound off.

GRAPHIC ELEMENTS - Add eye candy to your video with emoji's, gifs, b-roll or stock footage to keep the video moving and drive home your points

MUSIC & SOUND - Sound effects and music changes are something most people don't even notice while watching but it makes a huge difference to how engaged they are.

Remember, every single second matters in your video.

3. Determine the Payoff
-----------------------

Every video should end by satisfying the craving that you gave the viewer in the first 5 seconds (Your HOOK) and by answering the questions you raised in their minds.

If you see someone about to do a backflip on a trampoline, the payoff is usually a fail, and if you see someone cooking a meal, the payoff is seeing the final dish. No matter what, your viewer is watching your video for a reason and skipping this box on the checklist is like telling a joke with no punchline.

A mistake we see a lot of creators make, is they put their payoff in the middle of the video. One of our TikToks had the hook, "When I woke up and saw what Ryan Reynolds commented on my video I couldn't believe it..". When people hear this, they need to know what he said and what the video was. (BTW, if you want to watch the original video we made that got Ryan's attention, you can check it out here).

If you give the payoff away 15 seconds in, the viewer has gotten what they came for and they'll be scrolling regardless of how great the rest of your video is. This in turn tells the algorithm your video is a flop because it's only getting a 15 second average watch time.

When possible, make sure your payoff is in the last few moments of the video.

4. Relatability
---------------

Relatability is the key to people's attention.

If I start talking about characters from a show in the 50's, you're going to tune out because you probably can't relate. But if I start talking about your all time favourite TV character, you're going to be locked into what I am saying. The more people who can relate your video to their own life experiences, the better it's going to perform.

Meg & Glen on our team created a video with the hook 'This is what we do every time our daughter poops' (sounds gross.. but stay with us)! The reason the video got over 8 million views is that so many parents can relate to the struggle of 'Who's turn is it to change the diaper?'. TikTok was able to feed it into that niche and the majority of the comments are people talking about their own similar experience: relatability. For context, you can watch the video here (promise it's worth the laugh).

5. Shareability
---------------

If you get sent a video from a friend, it instantly has credibility and you know you're going to like it. So what makes content shareable?

You associate everyone you know with categories, whether it's the car they drive, what they eat, their hobbies, their likes, their dislikes etc. As a content creator, you need to create content that resonates with at least one of those niches.

We created a video on our 'Honest Ads' TiKTok account for Tesla. With 2.5 million views, it has over 20 thousand shares because everyone it was served to either knows someone who has a Tesla, or has an opinion on them.

A good indicator of how shareable (or relatable) a niche will be is how many times the hashtag has been used. The Tesla hashtag has 24 billion views, so it's safe to say that there are people on the platform who want to see Tesla content.

6. Repeatability
----------------

How you can start working smarter.. not harder as a creator.

If you have a viral video, that's great! BUT, it's not going to get you far if you aren't able to recreate it in a new way. Your goal should be to find a video format that works and explore a thousand ways to do it over again.

On Meg & Glen's TikTok channel, they posts a variety of different video formats, but one that works exceptionally well every single time is when the two of them do husband/wife challenges together. It's a content theme that's infinitely repeatable - here's an example if you're interested.

Conar on our team does the same thing on his golf-themed channel. He has a format themed around 'golfing with strangers' that consistently performs great with his audience of engaged golfers.

The lesson here? If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

This isn't to say you should put all your eggs into one basket when it comes to formats (though some creators do and see great success), but rather find a few formats that perform consistently well on your channels and recreate videos in that same vain.

If you've made it this far you should get prepared for a wave of dopamine as your video starts making it's way to thousands of phones around the world. BUT there are a few more small details we check before we hit post on every video. Ready?

SUBTITLES OR CAPTIONS - If you haven't added your own subtitles you'll probably want to use titles in the app. Make sure to add them while editing to make sure there are no typos. Most of the biggest creators on the app use subtitles so the video is enjoyable to anyone with the sound off.

THE THUMBNAIL - The thumbnail won't make or break your video, but if it's a repeatable idea and people want to find it on your feed, that will be impossible without adding a title to the thumbnail. For example our Honest Ads have a big block title with Honda, Yeti, or Tesla.

MUSIC/SOUND LABEL - If you edited off the TikTok or Instagram platforms, you NEED to find the song you used, add it, and turn the audio all the way down. This way it hits people who like the audio and it won't get taken down if the song is copyright.

HASHTAGS - We use specific hashtags for the niche the video is relatable to. If you use #honda, it will go to people who are interested in Honda. If you use #viral, it will go to ANYBODY. You have a better shot of a good watch time when you're intentional about who sees it first.
