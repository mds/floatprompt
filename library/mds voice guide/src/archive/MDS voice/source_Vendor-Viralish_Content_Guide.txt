This document compiles reference content from the Viralish system, which includes playbooks, checklists, and frameworks for creating short-form, high-retention video content.

Use this to inspire:

• Short-form video hooks

7 Elements of the Perfect Hook
------------------------------------------------

1. Create an Itch
	- Combine two things that don't usually go together

2. Curiosity Gap
	- Anchor the storyline to keep the viewer hooked through the big reveal

3. Start in the Action
	- Don't explain what you're going to do, JUST DO IT!
		A. Anchor
		B. Reveal

		Niche Examples
			- Cooking Videos
			- DIYs
			- Life Hacks
			- Expert Advice
			- Unboxing Videos
			- NEVER SAY "Hey guys, today I'm going to show you.."

4. Zero Backstory
	- How will you "un-niche" your hook?
	- Opening Shot (START WITH THIS)

5. Zero Chaos
	- Keep the viewer curious, never confused
	- LOOK!

6. Relatability
	- Ideas for connecting with viewers and improving engagement
	- Common Themes
	- Shared Experiences
	- Trending in the Media
	- Popular Products

7. Visual Storytelling
	- The hook must be understandable without sound:
	- Audio has captions or text
	- Shot fills the frame
	- Bright or contrasting colors
	- Good lighting

Engagement Tactics
---------------------------
- Wear something “unique” but never call attention to it.
- Unzip your fly
- Intentionally mispronounce something
- Disagree on camera ask the audience to settle the debate
- Place something absurd in the background of your video
- Wear a controversial shirt
- Intentionally use a tool or utensil wrong
- Make blatantly false claims about a topic



Subtle CTAs
---------------------------
“Settle this debate”
“I hope his boss sees this”
“Share with someone who...”
“Send this to someone who...”
“The world needs to see this”
“Tell us your favorite...”
“He deserves a raise”

HOW TO MAKE A GOOD VIDEO
------------------------

CHECKLIST FOR CREATORS
-----------------------

BEFORE YOU TURN ON THE CAMERA
------------------------------
- KEEP YOUR CONCEPT SIMPLE
  Make it simple enough that a five-year-old could understand.

  Good, simple premises:
  - My child is a demon!
  - How to clean your toilet
  - Hack to double your $$$!
  - My grandpa needs my kidney!
  - Wine Pie
  - There’s a family of raccoons in the bushes!

  Bad, overly-complex premises:
  - Grandpa doesn’t realize the surprise next door!
  - Revenge on my husband's prank!
  - Nobody liked him, until she came around.

- SHOW US SOMETHING UNIQUE, SURPRISING OR SHOCKING
  - Pour tequila into a coffee pot
  - Drop a $100 bill into sizzling oil
  - Cut a bike in half
  - “Show, don’t tell.” Let’s SEE something happen

- SET UP GOOD LIGHTING
  Face the subject, avoid harsh shadows, backlight, and reflections

- CHOOSE A SIMPLE BACKGROUND
  Avoid clutter. Make your subject ‘pop’

THE FIRST SECOND OF THE VIDEO
-----------------------------
- BEGIN WITH A SIMPLE SHOT
  One person or close-up of two objects max

- FILL UP THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE FRAME
  Put key visuals dead center. Avoid top/bottom edge.

- START IN ON THE ACTION
  Let the action begin as the video starts. Use slow, noticeable movement

- DON’T MOVE THE CAMERA
  Keep it still for comprehension. Zoom or pan only if slow and necessary

THE FIRST 15 SECONDS OF YOUR VIDEO
----------------------------------
- SEAMLESSLY FLOW INTO THE SECOND ACTION OR PLOT POINT
  Add new info to same frame, don’t swing camera away

- MAKE IT CLEAR WHERE YOUR VIDEO IS ‘GOING’
  Audience should know what they’re watching and what they’re waiting for

- ESTABLISH HIGH STAKES
  Make viewers care. Use high-impact, relatable stakes

DURING YOUR VIDEO
-----------------
- LEAD UP TO ONE BIG MOMENT
  Build toward an emotional payoff or visual reveal

- ADD EMOTIONS
  Use fear, anger, joy, admiration, awe

- STEADILY MOVE TOWARDS THE VIDEO’S MAIN OBJECTIVE
  No distractions. Mini-payoffs help

- GIVE PEOPLE AT LEAST THREE THINGS TO COMMENT ON
  - Appearance
  - Unique props
  - Moral dilemmas

PUBLISHING YOUR VIDEO
----------------------
- CREATE A CAPTION IN LINE WITH FACEBOOK’S NEW WATCHBAIT GUIDELINES
  - No ALL CAPS
  - No ellipses...
  - One emoji max
  - No “You won’t believe!”
  - No double !!
  - No “You have to see...”
  - Avoid “this...” and “when...”

  Instead, be direct:
  - Funny dog finds green ball!
  - Child steals from grandma’s purse and gets caught!

- PICK A GOOD THUMBNAIL
  Clear, well-lit, relevant to video

- PICK A TITLE THAT WILL NOT TRIGGER ‘EXTRA VIDEO REVIEW’
  Avoid mentions of protected classes or controversy

RULES TO LIVE BY
----------------
- FOLLOW ALL COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND MONETIZATION GUIDELINES
  Violations can demonetize your page for months

- DON’T GET US SUED
  - Don’t defame businesses
  - Don’t fake harmful stunts
  - Don’t impersonate brands
  - Don’t violate privacy
  - Don’t do anything dangerous
