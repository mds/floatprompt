> Before we get started, a few definitions...

## Definitions 
- **UX (User Experience) Designs** - Low fidelity designs in digital “sketch” format that define app functionality, user flow, and technical specifications. Provides a clear roadmap for full product development. ([Example](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qnq5qleprx4dst0/AABhVWhmiksxDMUKdc_37dBWa?dl=0))

- **UI (User Interface) Designs** - High fidelity designs that depict how the finished functioning app should appear in its final format. ([Example](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e3sg5inbi0peyam/AACNCaTLR98jACexKNlwvpAxa?dl=0))

- **QA (Quality Assurance) Testing** - Internal team reviewing development builds of the app to ensure proper implementation of functionality and design aesthetics.

---



## Applicable Project Experience

The *latter half* of the past decade at Studio Mds has accounted for a large amount of mobile design work. Including but not limited to the following:

- **2011** – [AT&T U-verse](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/u-verse/id312886438?mt=8), an iOS, Android, and Windows 7 app.
- **2012** – [8DAYS Eat](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/8-days-eat/id655926117?mt=8), an iOS app for Singapore’s largest national media company Mediacorp.

## MDS Staff

- **Matt D. Smith**, Owner and Design Director
- **Shana Smith** (part-time), CFO and stay-at-home-mom 
- **Various contractors** (project-based), design and development help on as-needed basis

## Anticipated 12Stone Design Resources

- [Matt D. Smith](/me)
- Possibly [Phil Goodwin](http://fhlcreative.com), a mid-level contract UX/UI designer. Phil works from my previous office, a coworking space in Athens, GA. He's a talented mid-level designer whom I've been design-mentoring for the past 6~ months.

---

> ...and now on to the meat and potatoes

## Proposal Packages
These packages are designed to give 12Stone the biggest bang for the buck at various budget levels.

---

### PACKAGE 01 
- UX Design (versions 1, 2, 3) Estimated 6-8 weeks
- UI Design (version 1 only) Estimated 3-4 weeks
- QA Testing - Biweekly check-ins over 8 weeks during development (September – October)
- **Total Cost $80,000** *(non-recurring)*

> 50% of budget for UX, 40% for UI, and 10% for QA
<br /> Estimated 1-2 designers

---

### PACKAGE 02 
- UX Design (version 1 only) Estimated 3-4 weeks
- UI Design (version 1 only) Estimated 3-4 weeks
- QA Testing - Biweekly check-ins over 8 weeks during development (September – October)
- **Total Cost $60,000** *(non-recurring)*

> 50% of budget for UX, 40% for UI, and 10% for QA
<br /> Estimated 1-2 designers

---

### PACKAGE 03 
- UX Design (version 1 only) Estimated 3-4 weeks
- **Total Cost $30,000** *(non-recurring)*

>**Update: Mon, March 28 3:22pm**<br />
This package would allow a clear roadmap to be established and all of the screens designed in low fidelity. Development could begin with these documents completed and an internal graphic designer at 12Stone (or elsewhere) could *skin* the wireframes into higher fidelity designs.

---

## Timeline
I'm confident we could hit the deadlines oulined in the 12Stone RFP with any of the above packages, assuming the ball got rolling relatively quickly.

>- designs started in early April 2016
- preliminary designs completed by May 1, 2016
- final designs completed by June 1, 2016
- QA testing during September and October, 2016

---

# 2012 Year in Review

I'm writing this post for myself because I like getting all nostalgic and this will make it easier. Perhaps you will find it interesting.

2012 marked my 4th full year of self-employment and was by far my most successful year. My company, Studio MDS, LLC has employed me and my wife as salaried employees for the last few years and it's been great. It's amazing what being debt free and having a cash reserve will do for your business and personal life. I'll probably right a much longer post about that later. Anyways, here are some highlights from 2012.

##Professionally

1. Lead the creative and visual direction for the AT&T Uverse Mobile apps for iPhone, Android and Windows 7 with the 2012 UX Grand Prize winning team at Mobients, Inc. This was a super fun project to work on and really challenged and stretched my mobile UX/UI skills. Huge shout out to Eric Irvin, Merewyn Heath, Ruby Velle, Natacha Ruivo, Sandy Fershee, Jaqueline Walsh, Yvonne Cavaria, and Matthew Perry. Such a fun group to work with.

2. Lead the UX and visual design for a new iPhone app called Moment Reel. Adam Saladino handled the development and did a phenomenal job. 

3. Work heated up in Singapore early in the year as Dan, Ian, and myself completed 6 big 360º projects for City Developments Limited (CDL), one of Singapore's leading property developers. We've been selected as their vendor of choice for their future developments.

4. Dan, Ian, and myself also completed the Singapore National HeritageFest 360º, a project for the Singapore National Heritage Board, which showcases 6 national monuments and the stories behind them. The project won a FWA Award. Woot!

5. Designed a new site for my church athensvineyard.com Thanks to Kelvin Ling for the dev work!
 
6. The long overdue studiomds.com was finally launched in September and nabbed an Awwwards site of the day. Woot! Shout out to Dan for helping with the content and Adam Clark for development. I also got my hands super dirty with SCSS during the project. I lurved it.

7. I lead the UX and visual design for a new healthcare iPad app for Shareable Ink, a Nashville based company that received $5M in Series B funding in June of 2012.

8. I lead the creative and visual direction for a new private label Movie Theatre iPhone app by National Cash Register (NCR) along side Two Way Dialogue and Maestral Solutions.

9. Completed a number of other panorama tours in including, Matchbox Concept Hostel, Le Article Furniture Boutique, Stone Summit Climbing, and 3 hotel tours for Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

Hopefully I can post some more mobile case studies soon!

##Family

1. My son Justice, turned 2 on January 29, 2012. We celebrated at home with a low key family party. At some point during the year Justice learned to pedal and balance Noah's bicycle with no training wheels all by himself! 2 years old people! Proof.

2. My lovely wife Shana turned the big 3-0 on August 11, 2012. She's two months older than me so needless to say, I had fun being 29 for 8 weeks while she was 30. She did not share in my excitement. It was light hearted, honest. We had a super fun dinner party with a few friends in downtown Athens. Sushi, drinks and hilarity ensued.

3. My son Noah turned 5 on August 13, 2012. I can't believe my first born is already 5. Man time flies. I was still working a full-time job when he was born and so was Shana. When Noah turned 1, Shana was able to take on the most difficult job that I know of, being a stay-at-home mom. I'm super grateful to have my wife at home raising our beautiful children. You're the best baby!

4. Shana and I celebrated our 7th year of marriage! We treated ourself with a trip to New York for 4 days with NO kids, thanks to "Nan," Shana's wonderful mom! We had an amazing time and even met up with Dan, who was visiting from Singapore. We used Airbnb for the first time and really liked it. However, our host did not tell us that there were NO towels (due to sanitary reasons!?) so for the first 2 days we shared 1 single dishtowel as our primary means of drying off - that and drip drying in front of the wall AC unit.

5. After the two months of harassing my wife subsided, I myself finally hit the big 3-0. It feels weird to say that I'm 30 because I just don't feel 30. Weird I know.

6. My beautiful daughter Isa turned 1 on December 1, 2012. She has truly stolen my heart! We had a joint party for her with my little niece Audrey, who also turned 1 on December the 4th. Isa is walking a ton and her favorite word is "Dada!" *heart melts*

7. My wife and I got our house painted and got new windows installed. Home remodeling is fun but slow, especially when you do everything on a cash-basis. Lot's more to do but it's coming along.

I've been blessed beyond all measure and thank God so much for allowing me to have such a full life. 

##Goals for 2013

I'll get more specific on these soon but for now here are some high level things that I'm working towards.

1. Go to bed by 10pm each day and wake up at 5am
2. Stick with a bible reading plan daily
3. Write 250 words minimum daily
4. Read a book a month
5. Go on a guys trip
6. Go on 3 or more family vacations
7. Learn more Spanish (enough to be conversational)
8. Learn 3 epic guitar solos
9. Reach 180 lbs. by June 1st
10. Watch calories better and start running more frequently
11. Gross 75% more total income for Studio MDS in 2013
12. Send more pictures to my grandmother in California

So far I'm 4 days into 2013 and I'm feeling incredibly motivated. I still need to get some solid measurable items in place for each goal, so perhaps I'll write about that in another post.

What are your goals?

# 2013 Year in Review

2013 marked my 5th year in business for myself. The year was great as I did incrementally increase revenue but also worked a lot less. With a few exceptions here and there, it was a nice easy pace throughout the year.

I did dabble with the idea of taking on a full-time position at a few different companies, but in the end things didn't align and I'm super happy about that.

I've finally realized and more importantly, confirmed, that I truly enjoy being self-employed and have dislodged the idea that the grass is greener somewhere else. Being self-employed allows me to pick and choose the projects I work on and gives me greater freedom with how I spend my time.

Without further ado, here are some of the things under my belt in 2013.

---

# Professional
I still had a bit of a focus on mobile apps, but this year also had a larger dose of responsive web projects. Here are some highlights below.

### 8 DAYS iPhone App
This project technically started in the end of 2012, but I didn't include it in last year's review. My friend and Singaporean business partner, Dan, came to me with an opportunity to create an iPhone app for Singapore's largest media provider, Mediacorp. I busted out some serious UX and UI design for this project. In addition, I spent 50% of my time battling internal politics with the client, which was a huge challenge. But the results were worth it.

The [8 DAYS Eat app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/8-days-eat/id655926117?mt=8) launched, and to date, has been the most successful digital initiative that Mediacorp has released.

### Dwell 360
I designed the interface and shot the panoramas of a home in Atlanta for the very first [Dwell 360º interactive tour](http://www.dwell.com/uploads/dwell-sonos/index.html) featured on dwell.com

### Graceland: Undercover iPad App and Interactive Panoramas
I worked in collaboration with Mobients on a second-screen iPad app for the new TV show, Graceland. This project was a doozy.

I traveled to the set of the show in Ft. Lauderdale and shot [panoramas of the entire thing](http://mds.sh/graceland/360/b).

I also led a creative team of 3 and headed up UI design for the entire project. There were at least 3 all-nighters involved. It almost sucked the life out of me, but hey, It did make the front page of [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2013/06/06/graceland-undercover/). I forgot to replace my avatar in the PSDs that I delivered to NBC for the video and you can see my mug in the promo video, _codename: XONYD_, pretty funny.

I whipped together a quick site to show some of the designs as well as other recent apps. It doesn't work on mobile because I got lazy and this was done as an experiment. Have a look [here](http://mds.sh/app-design).

### Thinketh.co
This was a fun little side project I did based on one of my favorite books of all-time. I've probably read or listened to this book over 10 times. You should seriously go [read it](http://thinketh.co). The [purpose](http://thinketh.co/purpose) page gives more insight into why I made it.

### Transform Athens
In April, I started a monthly design meetup with [Jacob Thomason](http://twitter.com/oojacoboo). Transform Athens grew from 0 to over 100 members in 2013, and has been a really fun project to work on and see grow. We had a variety of topics and speakers from a number of folks including, [Neil Summerour](http://positype.com), [Marco Suarez](http://twitter.com/marcosuarez), [Aarron Walter](http://aarronwalter.com), [Chris Harrison](http://cdharrison.com), and more. If you're in or around the Atlanta/Athens area and would like to present a topic or attend, let me know! I should probably write a separate Transform 2013 review soon.

### Conferences
This year I set out to go to 3 conferences and did just that. I had an amazing time at each one.

##### Greenville Grok
This was my second time attending Greenville Grok. It's such a great conference with a huge focus on conversation and fun. I've already bought my tickets for Grok 2013. You should [too](http://grok.cc)!

##### Circles Conference
My friend Ish knows how to do it right. Circles 2013 was a blast and incredibly inspirational. I met a ton of folks and made some great friendships. [Duckfaces](https://twitter.com/mds/status/381103940370059264) with Bill Kenney, [slow-mo jumps](http://instagram.com/p/es9R2IjKJK/) with Joshua Krohn, and multiple [BBQ outings](http://instagram.com/p/ec4qH1jWEE/) with the Focus Lab crew, are just a few of the highlights.

##### Brooklyn Beta
I wrote a [separate post](http://mattdsmith.com/brooklyn-beta-2013/) about this. Nothing I can write describes its awesomeness. Just go if you can.

### Shiplify
I began work for a small Atlanta-based startup, Shiplify. I've been doing a ton of design and product strategy work for them, including branding, UX design and wireframing, responsive web design, copywriting, business strategy and more. This has been one of the funnest projects I've had the pleasure to work on. I designed nearly all of the wireframes on a projector with the CEO sitting beside me due to the fact that I had nearly zero knowledge of commercial shipping logistics. It's been an incredible experience thus far and I plan to continue working with them in the future. Blog posts about this process soon to come as well.

### Responsive Web Portal
I busted out some design concepts for (*Redacted*) in collaboration with Macquarium. The designs were extremely well received and helped Macquarium win a big account. I posted lots of the designs on [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/mds/projects/162112-Mystery-Blue).

### Float Label Pattern
Whoa. This was a big one. The float label pattern was a sort of crazy viral thing that happened in October and November, based on a [Dribbble shot](http://floatlabel.com) of mine, a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jverdi/JVFloatLabeledTextField) by [Jared Verdi](http://twitter.com/jverdi), and a [blog post](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/float-label-pattern/) by [Brad Frost](http://twitter.com/brad_frost). My web traffic exploded over 6,000% during November and trickled back down in December.

![mds stats](/content/images/2014/Jan/mds_nov_stats-1.jpg)

### Started Writing a Book
I started writing a book about "doing your own thing" since I've been doing just that for 5 years now. I had a lofty goal of finishing before Thanksgiving of last year, but only got about 25% of the way through. I didn't do the hardwork to finish it when my motivation was peaking, but I do plan to get back on track this year and finish it off.

### Cowork Athens
I wanted to get a proper coworking space setup in Athens, but I needed to have a community going first. This was the reason I started Transform Athens. Right now Cowork is a slow moving beast that will happen in time, I'm just letting it organically evolve for now. If you're interested, hop over to the [website](http://coworkathens.com) to learn more.

### Athens Made Branding
There is an initiative for a brand to be built behind Athens businesses, organizations, entrepreneurs, freelancers, and more. I designed a preliminary concept and am still waiting to see how it all pans out. I [wrote a post](http://mattdsmith.com/athens-made) explaining the thought process behind my design for Athens Made.

---

# Personal
The biggest news of 2013 on a personal note, is that my wife is pregnant with number 4. We currently have 2 boys and 1 girl, and are now expecting boy number 3. Raising kids is no simple task, but the rewards are so high. My heart has never been so full in my life and will continue to expand and stretch with our new little addition, who is due on Mother's day of this year.

Also, this spring will wrap up my wife's first full year of homeschooling our oldest son for kindergarten, while at the same time entertaining our other two. I have an amazing amount of respect for my wife and am really proud that she is taking such good care of our kids while I'm working. I tell people all the time that her job is much harder than mine. 

My wife recently flew to Texas for a wedding, while I stayed home with the kids from a Thursday through Sunday. Filling her shoes for those 3-4 days reminds me so well of all of the things my wife handles and takes care of, many of which I take for granted or don't think of them as much of a big deal. I love this kind of reality check, as it helps me understand and appreciate her struggles as well as empathize with her on a deeper level.

Here's a photo of our family from a little Christmas photo shoot from last year.

# Goals for 2014
I have one main goal for 2014. Write everyday. Most years I create some well rounded list of goals [(like I did last year)](http://mattdsmith.com/2012-year-in-review). Some of them are met and most are not. This year I'm focusing on one thing and that's just writing. Here are the specifics:

### What
Write everyday for a minimum of 30 minutes. I'm going to try an increment of time, rather than a number of words, to begin with. I'll see how it goes and over time I may switch it up as I progress.

### Why
Writing is good for the soul. It's good to put thoughts into words. It helps you think. It lets others know how you think and gives you a platform to share your ideas and thoughts. I've been designing professionally for nearly a decade and have run a successful independent studio for 5 full years now. I've got lots of experience and valuable lessons learned to share. I've been a casual blogger here and there, but looking back over the years, I would really love to have had a catalog of design challenges, personal thoughts, etc. spanning those years. I have  a lot of experiences, opinions and a lot to say, and now I really want to get into the habit of doing that.

### How
I'm going to make a time commitment to write for 30 minutes everyday. The goal is to do it when I first wake up with a nice big mug of hot coffee. If for any reason I fail to do it in the morning, I will make sure that I knock it out that night before going to bed. 30 minutes minimum, that's it. Substitute writing for one show on Netflix and your done.

### When
In the morning. I already said that, geez...

### Who
I want to have a few people to hold me accountable to this one goal. I've got some in mind but haven't set this in motion yet. More on this later.

### Additional Goals 
My other goals include running more, working on more personal projects, bettering myself as a front-end developer, and growing Transform Athens. Also, to stay [curious](/curiosity-stronger-than-fear/curious).

# 2014 Year in Review

Another year is in the books so let’s recap. I’ve done this for [2012](/2012) and [2013](/2013) and looking back on those reviews, I’m so glad I captured the highlights when I did. There’s always the “ohhhh yeah” moments when I scroll back through the otherwise fuzzy timeline. So here goes in semi-chronological order:

---

## Athensmade
The [Athensmade](http://athensmade.com) logo project was an initiative to unite the professional community of Athens, GA. Set into motion by [Four Athens](http://fourathens.com), there was a logo design contest to determine our city’s unofficial “Made in Athens” mark. I don’t like logo contests, but I felt different about this one. You can read what happened [here](/athens-made). TL;DR I won the contest and [this is the logo](https://dribbble.com/shots/1311372-Athens-Made).

## Wireframing with Illustrator and InDesign
After several friends showed serious interest in my wireframing process, I decided to [blog about the whole thing](/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/). And moments before hitting publish, I made a product out of the wireframing kit instead of giving it away for free. That article alone generated over 34,000 visitors on my site in 2014 and the *kit* generated nearly $1,500 worth of sales.

This whole process led to me writing “[Understanding Vector Shapes in Illustrator](http://mattdsmith.com/understanding-vector-shapes-in-illustrator/)” in April, which generated over 24,000 visitors this year.

These two posts’ popularity encouraged me to start a [new thing](/new-thing), which I’ll cover more below.

## Shiplify
The crew at [Shiplify](http://shiplify.com) reached out back in 2013 seeking some serious UX and UI help for their responsive web app that manages commercial shipments and transportation logistics. The product was created with a mobile-first approach, which proved incredibly helpful for the enormous amount of user input required for creating and managing shipments.

During this project I seriously leveled up in mobile form design, which I was already tinkering with in 2013 with the whole [Float Label](/float-label-pattern) thing.

I’ve still yet to write about the intricacies of this project, which is something I really want to do.

## Dr. Phillips Center
This was a responsive website I worked on with [Macquarium](http://macquarium.com). I created a lot of the visual concepts and experimented with [element collages](https://dribbble.com/shots/1411182-Lion-King-Element-Collage) for the first time.

The site is [live](http://drphillipscenter.org), but unfortunately I wasn’t able to be a part of the team that saw it through into final production, so it only contains about 60% of the vision I had for it. 

## Wells Fargo Museum
Another project knocked out with Macquarium. I led the entire UX and creative effort producing storyboards, wireframes, and ultimately visual comps. This was a mobile-only site for people visiting the Wells Fargo Museum in-person. I never posted much of this online because banks and NDAs. But, here are [some icons](https://dribbble.com/shots/1437318-Old-School-Travel) I made for it.

## Krispy Kreme
The third project I worked on with Macquarium this year. A quick pitch for [Krispy Kreme](https://dribbble.com/shots/1607941-Best-Friends-Forever).

## Timer+
A fun little [iOS app](https://dribbble.com/mds/projects/219002-Timer) I designed that allows multiple timer to run simultaneously.

## Personal Site Updates
I finally updated the default Ghost theme running my site with a [little customization of my own](https://dribbble.com/shots/1637158-Responsive-site-tweaks). For the last 10 years, I would *always* design my site first before creating content for it, and I just couldn’t stand the thought of going from version 1 to version 20 before I launched, yet again. I bit the bullet, installed Ghost with the default theme and started writing. No one made fun of me, publicly at least, and it’s likely that no one ever remembers or cares what it looked like. The important thing for me was that I just started publishing. 

## Roadie
Roadie is like Über for shipping. It allows you to take advantage of your commute and any other road trips to pick up extra cash. I led the [UI design](https://dribbble.com/mds/projects/236882-Roadie) of the iOS app and the marketing site, which should both be launching in January 2015. I’ll also continue consulting with them to help polish the next version of the app in the first quarter of 2015.

## Slingput
I got to know [Michael Tavani](http://twitter.com/tavani) after he spoke in Athens at a startup event. He’s a seriously driven dude and we’ve worked on a few things together since we first met. The one that finally saw the light of day is [Slingput](http://slingput.com). I was only able to dedicate about 4 late night design sessions to the inner workings of the responsive web app, but hey, it launched!

## 706P
A few friends of mine started a competitive amateur cycling team in Athens a few years back called *The 706 Project*. They needed a new look so I designed a [new logo](https://dribbble.com/shots/1722746-706P) for their team and even expanded it into a [full typeface](https://dribbble.com/shots/1742307-On-the-Fontier) for them. I’m also working on designing their full cycling kits, [sponsorship proposals](https://dribbble.com/shots/1737317-Cycling-Sponsorship-Proposal), etc.

## AIUX
[AIUX](/aiux) is the culmination of the Illustrator-related posts mentioned above. For now it’s a name to produce all of my Illustrator content under. And in the future it will become a product for anyone to learn Adobe Illustrator for rapid UX design. 

## Rivalry!
This is YO! for sportsball. Football actually. I helped a local group in Athens rethink their [on-boarding process](https://dribbble.com/shots/1814141-YO-for-Sportsball/attachments/300324) for their iOS app and I designed a new [visual system](https://dribbble.com/shots/1814141-YO-for-Sportsball/attachments/300330) for their UI. 

## Martens Marine
My friend and business partner, [Dan](http://twitter.com/imissedtheshock), rounded up a fun redesign project to close out the year. Martens Marine builds giant vessels–tugboats, etc. in Singapore and needed a stronger online presence to help their growing company. This should be launching in January 2015. Here are some [process shots](https://dribbble.com/mds/projects/250637-Martens-Marine).

## 9 Years of Marriage
My wife and I celebrated 9 years of marriage together in September. Man, I love that woman more and more everyday. I’m really amazed at how far we’ve come with our relationship, communication skills, and overall emotional heath and maturity. I’m incredibly thankful to have such a great person raising my children and supporting me in all that I do. Love ya, babe.

## Four Kids
In May 2014, my wife and I welcomed another little bundle of joy into the world.  Now we have [four](/four) kids. Crazy. [Nixon](/nixon) is 7 months old now and is the happiest little guy ever. He’s constantly smiling and oozing with joy.

My oldest, Noah, is now 7 and is becoming such a little boy. He has so much energy it’s insane. He thrives on structure, personal attention, and focused activities. He’s very intelligent and can find a loophole in just about any *directions* you give him.

Next is Justice, who’s a month away from turning 5. He’s our little introverted fireball who loves playing legos (or Mario) for hours on end. He reminds me a lot of myself when I was young. Justice is really good at coloring and drawing pictures, I’m excited to cultivate that more in him. 

Isa, my sweet little girl, is now 3 years old. There’s something about a little girl that just freaking melts your heart. It’s hard to describe. She loves going with me anywhere, no matter the errand. She also loves when I “snuggle with her” in her toddler bed. My feet hang off the end, but man it’s sweet. She’s really independent and doesn’t let her brothers get away with much.

## Cycling
I finally found *my thing* when it comes to personal fitness. I’ve done P90X, I’ve ran, I’ve lifted weights, but it’s always been hard to keep up any activity consistently. I [bought a bike](http://mattdsmith.com/riding-again/) near the end of 2013 for commuting the 5+ miles between my house and office. 

I enjoyed the commute, but found myself wanting to go for longer rides. So I’d leave on my bike after work and go out for 10-15 miles before coming home. This was a great workout physically and mentally. Pedaling on windy country roads with zero distraction for over an hour really lets your mind decompress. I highly recommended it if you’re considering getting into cycling.

I did get a proper road bike during the middle of the year after accidentally destroying my commuter bike. It was strapped to the roof of our van and after a long 4 hour commute with 4 kids, one tends to lose focus on anything other than simply *getting home.* We finally made it home so I drove straight into the garage without considering my vertically extended cargo, effectively crushing the bike frame and totaling my poor commuter bike.

![old bike](http://photos-d.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xap1/t51.2885-15/10522791_284161891763459_855440524_n.jpg)

![new bike](http://scontent-b-lga.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/928666_287789034742457_1795961618_n.jpg)

My new bike, albeit more costly, is better suited for my cycling  adventures now. Here are some fun 2014 stats pulled from Strava, my ride-tracking app of choice:

**Year-to-Date**

- Distance: 1,646 mi
- Time: 101h 31m
- Elev Gain: 76,401 ft
- Rides: 95
- Biggest Ride: 47 mi

## Plans for 2015
My biggest plan for 2015 will be putting more focused energy into [AIUX](/aiux) and seeing how a larger scale product launch goes. I’d like to transition into more of my own products and less client work. We’ll see how it goes.

# 2015 Year in Review


Alright, alright, alright. A new year is upon us and that means it’s time for a recap post. This was my **10th** and most successful year of full-time freelance. I *passed* on many projects and only had a handful of longer engagement clients. That really helped me focus on my side project, AIUX. More on that in a bit.

## Roadie
<img src="/content/images/2016/01/roadie-icon-1.svg" style="float: left; padding: 2em 2em 2em 0" alt="roadie icon">
I kicked off the year with an extension of the work I had done the previous fall in 2014. I got involved with [Roadie](http://roadie.com) when it was just an idea and worked with as a part of the core team to bring it to life.

Last year I collaborated on the UX and designed all of the UI for iOS and Android apps. This year we refined some features, created a better onboarding sequence, and crafted a big style guide to help position Roadie for building their own internal team.

I made a [fun little website](http://mds.sh/roadie) to hand things off in style. (*actual dropbox links have been removed from the site*)

It’s been fun to see their progress since then, like getting a shout out on the [Jimmy Kimmel show](https://vimeo.com/120739374), the [collaboration with Ludacris](https://www.roadie.com/blog/2015/09/introducing-the-roadie-and-ludacris-collaboration), the [coverage on Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/3043449/fast-feed/riding-wave-of-free-waffles-stuff-schlepping-app-roadie-expands-to-all-50-states), and [lots more](https://www.roadie.com/about/press).

## Skyscanner
<img src="/content/images/2016/01/skyscanner-icon.svg" style="float: left; padding: 2em 2em 2em 0" alt="skyscanner icon">
[Skyscanner](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/05/14/skyscanner-inside-scotlands-tech-titan-one-worlds-largest-flight-search-engines/#gref) is one of the largest flight and hotel search companies in the world. A small team they recently acquired was building a new version of their business traveler app and they contracted me to help design their UX and UI.

This was a great project. Not only did I have an amazing team to work with, they flew me to Scotland for a week to have a solid working session with the team. See a few pictures here [#mdsinscotland](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mdsinscotland/)

I had a pizza eating competition with Ross, the Head of Corporate Travel, and tied. He likes to say he won, but we **very clearly agreed** that the side arugula salad did not count towards the final tally. *Side note: I hate arugula salad*.

The Skyscanner business traveler app is called TravelPro. It lets multiple from the same organization search for and book flights and hotels, then forward the itineraries to a manager for purchase. Employees within the same company can see who has booked certain flights and hotels to make travel collaboration easier. 

The largest task was designing the responsive web app, followed by the iOS app. They were constantly building the app in tandem while it was being designed, to things moved really quickly. 

I haven’t posted any of the work online, because they wanted to wait until it was publicly available. I’ll be sure to post the designs soon. Definitely proud of the work we did together.

## Babycents
<img src="/content/images/2016/01/babycents-icon-1.svg" style="float: left; padding: 2em 2em 2em 0" alt="babycents icon">
This was a project for a client in New York. I designed the UX and wireframes for a comparison shopping application focused on baby and kids items. I flew up there and had a few working days with them and spent a few weeks designing a solid set of wireframes to help flesh out functionality and map out a vision for the initial release of the product. 


## Involved
<img src="/content/images/2016/01/involved-icon-1.svg" style="float: left; padding: 2em 2em 2em 0" alt="involved icon">
Involved is an initiative from the New Growth and Development department of Cox Communications. [The web app](http://www.involvededucation.com) allows parents with children in public school sign up for a free account, log in with their parent portal username and password, then get texts or emails of their kid’s grades as they’re available.

Half of my project efforts were dedicated to creating conceptual demos to help the internal team sell the idea upstream to get budget, and the other half was designing the actual project. It can be tough to switch gears between those two extremes, but it’s a necessary challenge for some organizations. 

## AIUX
<img src="/content/images/2016/01/aiux-icon-1.svg" style="float: left; padding: 2em 2em 2em 0" alt="aiux icon">
This was my **biggest goal for 2015** and one that I’m proud to have [accomplished and shipped](https://rwd.aiux.co). The idea took [root](/doing-a-new-thing) back in May of 2014 so I started small with a [variety of blog posts](/aiux) loosely covering the topic of using Illustrator for UX design.

The files and tutorials I produced gained traction and momentum, so I started planning a full online-course. I knew the course videos would be the most difficult piece to create so I focused on those first. Once they were complete I started exploring options for where and how to host my the course. 

Pretty quickly I decided to design and build my own course software web app. I used the same techniques I teach in the course to build the app—*eating your own dog food some people call it.* 

I recruited my friend [Jess Brown](http://twitter.com/brownwebdesign) to help build the Ruby back-end while I designed and coded the front side of things.

This project ruined me for future projects in the best possible way. Now it’s going to be incredibly tough to NOT write the front-end code for the projects I design. Pushing design updates to a live app via code is a pretty invigorating feeling. Much more so than handing off a set of static designs. 

I hit a few bumps along the way, but I’ll cover that in a much more thorough post. The first two quarters of 2015 were pretty slam packed with client work, but that gave me the flexibility to take off all of June and July to get cranking on the AIUX course.

Here’s a rough breakdown of the time it took to build and ship the product:

>**June - July** (7 weeks, took 1 week off for family vacation)
Created the videos for the course and started preliminary designs for the course app.

>**August - September** (3 weeks, took roughly 5 weeks off for client work)
Refined the designs for the app and coded the entire front-end. 

>**October** (1 week, spent the other 3 weeks working on a client project)
Launched the private beta to over 100 people. Got great feedback on the app, the videos and more. Took this time to re-record some of the lessons and continued to refine things.

>**November** (2-3 weeks, hodgepodge of client work and writing and designing the sales page for the course)

>**December** (2 weeks, launched the public version of the course, refined the sales page, and did a ton of customer support)

>**Total** 16 weeks (4 months)

All in all I’m pretty satisfied with the first launch. I had about 60 people buy the course for a total of $20k~ in revenue the first week and another $10k~ that will come in over the next 5 months from people who opted for the payment plan.

This isn’t enough to be profitable (yet) based on the amount of time and money I’ve spent so far, but definitely enough to validate the product. Now there’s a great foundation laid that I can build upon with AIUX and any other course I want to create in the future.

The beta feedback was great, but now that I have paying customers, I’m expecting even more candid comments to help make the course even better.

I'll open and close the course publicly at least 4 more times in 2016. Each time I'll gather feedback and improve the content.

## Readable
<img src="/content/images/2016/01/readable-icon.svg" style="float: left; padding: 2em 2em 2em 0" alt="readable icon">
I took a day or two while coding the front-end of AIUX to make this [little plugin](http://mds.sh/readable). It helps you see a mark between the 45th and 75th character of any paragraph, so you know where to optimally break your lines when styling the front-end of a site. [See it in action here](http://mds.sh/readable).

## Ride Font
<img src="/content/images/2016/01/ride-icon.svg" style="float: left; padding: 2em 2em 2em 0" alt="ride icon">
I was really into cycling in 2014. A friend of mine helps run a local, amateur competitive cycling team and I designed their logo and cycling jerseys.

They needed some additional decals and merchandise designed, so I took the original logo I created and made a full font out of it. 

The font is 99% complete and I even submitted it to myfonts.com. They gave me some great feedback to correct a few things, but I decided to put my focus on AIUX first. It will probably only take a day or two to wrap up the font for release.

Huge props to [Mattox Shuler](http://fortfoundry.com) for teaching me the ropes of Glyphs App. It’s a great vector editing program and provides such granular control it’s crazy. I  even used it to create the [AIUX logotype](https://dribbble.com/shots/2139347-AIUX-Logotype). 

## The Quad turned 1
<img src="/content/images/2016/01/quad-icon.svg" style="float: left; padding: 2em 2em 2em 0" alt="quad icon">
In April of 2014, I [helped start](http://mds.is/the-grass-is-greener-where-you-water-it/) a coworking space called [The Quad](http://thequad.co). It’s alive and kicking with 12 full-time members and a handful of part timers. Being 100% independent, it’s been awesome to have this little community of people to work around. [You can read about the origin story here](/the-grass-is-greener-where-you-water-it/).

## Gooey Font
This is a secret project that [Mattox](http://twitter.com/mattoxshuler) and I began toying with last fall. It's going to be huge, I can feel it. It’s a *new approach* to an icon/font that will super-charge your projects. If you want to stay in the loop, [go here and enter you name and email](/gooey).

## Good Button
I [coded this up](/making-good-buttons) while working on the Skyscanner interface. It’s fun to supply developers with actual code they can plug in instead of expecting them to recreate it 100% identical to what you’ve designed. [You can see Good Button in action here](/making-good-buttons/).

## Speaking
Speaking is weird. It’s stressful to prepare for and kind of stressful doing, but once it’s finished it really doesn't seem like that big of a deal. It’s kind of exhilarating.

This year I worked on a presentation called "[Responsive Design in the Real World](/real)" and gave a slightly version of it 5 different times.

- [Squares Conference](http://squaresconference.com) 
- [amUX Meetup](http://amux.org)
- [New Media Institute](http://mynmi.net)
- [UGA Hackathon](http://ugahacks.herokuapp.com) 
- [UGA Graphic Design](http://gdclub.uga.edu)

## Fitness
Last year I went cycling a lot. 1,646 miles to be exact. This year I only got in 301.8 miles on the bike and 60 miles running.

What I didn’t do in cardio though, I did in strength training. I lifted weights roughly 3 times per week and got my deadlift max up to 415 lbs.

I feel way stronger now and I’m planning for 2016 to be a blend of continued lifting with a lot more cardio integrated. 

💪

## 10 Years of Marriage
![matt and shana](/content/images/2015/10/10years.jpg)

This year marks a **full decade** of being married to my best friend. We dated for four years before we got married so now we’ve been together now for 14 years. Fourteen. Years. That’s insane. I can wholeheartedly say that I would not have accomplished half the things in my life without this incredibly strong and supportive woman by my side. I can’t imagine living life and raising four kids with any other human on the planet.

## 2016
This year will be focused primarily on fine-tuning the AIUX course, possibly revamping the whole thing for AIUX 2.0, maybe even another course or two. I’m also incredibly into learning about email automation and creating evergreen sales funnels to make the course be sustainable throughout the entire year as opposed to one-off public launches.

Some other random goals:

- Redesign this site by the end of Q1
- Write for a minimum of 30 minutes daily
- Publish a blog post and email newsletter weekly
- Start more design tutorials for Illustrator, Sketch, and Project Comet. Maybe even some code tutorials for designers.
- Release my [Freelance Fire](/beta-releasing-a-book) book by the end of Q2
- Buy a Nissan Juke Nismo by the end of Q3. 
- Have a noticeable six-pack (instead of a two-pack) by the end of Q1. Abs not beer. 
- My wife bought me a [new guitar for Christmas](https://www.instagram.com/p/_uHMN-jKKw/) and I’m pretty pumped about it, so I want to learn more scales, modes, licks, and runs in 2016. Nothing too specific, just playing more. 
- Attend at least 3-5 conferences. Excited that I’ve got 2 lined up to speak at already.
- Play more with my kids and have a date night with one of them at least twice a month.
- Have at least 2 date nights a month with my wife.
- Have our current house ready to be sold by the end of Q3. Our 3 bedroom and 2 bath can only cut it for so long with four kids. 
- Say NO to more things.
- Laser focus.

Alrighty. That’s all for now. Happy New Year!

# 2016 Year in Review

> Life’s like an hourglass glued to the table.
- Anna Nalick

After listing everything from the past year, I feel a *deep realization* that more than half of these items should have been their very own, thoroughly written blog post. Be that as it may, I’ll do my best to sum it up below.

### AIUX
I recapped AIUX in my 2015 post, but it was near the end of year when I first launched the course and much more has happened since then. 

In an effort to increase automation last year, my friend Jess and I built a feature into the AIUX course back-end system based on the concept of launch tokens.

My _“funnel”_ is far from optimized at the moment, but here’s how it works...

- You sign up for my case study emails at learnaiux.com
- That triggers a campaign inside of Drip that sends out all of the emails I’ve written, beforehand.
- At the end of the Learn AIUX campaign, you’re moved into my _bridge_ campaign. It’s a short 2-3 email campaign spread out over a few days and gives you the opportunity to let me know that you’re interested in the full AIUX online course I built.
- If you click that button you go a special _launch_ page I made for AIUX. It thanks you for your interest and lets you know that the course will open soon.
- When you land on that _launch_ page, your email is passed through the URL and into my backend course system.
- My course app then creates a _launch token_ based on your email.
- Your email is now tagged to receive my sales campaign emails, starting the following Monday of whenever you confirmed your interest in the course.
- If you visit the same _launch_ URL before the following Monday, it was still say “thank you for your interest.”
- The _launch token_ created in my course app, coincides with the sales email campaign inside of Drip. It gives you a 5 day window to register for the course before it closes again. After that you’ll see a legitimate _course closed_ page and you can’t access the enrollment page until I physically open enrollment again.

It was a little complicated to setup, but works really well and it’s all automated. 

This little foray into app and email integration on the pre-sales side of things got my friend Jess and I really interested rebuilding the app as a whole to be SaaS product for course creators.

We’re in the super early stages of that now, but I’ll be posting more later on. 
 
### Drip/ConvertKit
I did lots of experimenting with email in 2016. I started on MailChimp, moved to ConvertKit, and moved again to Drip. In the end I really like the way Drip’s visual workflows worked and they’re API is pretty easy to work with.

It's been a challenge to dig into email marketing, and I still feel like I suck at it in a lot of ways, but that's how you get better right?
 
### Timber Update
My buddy Taylor watched all of my email mojo from afar with AIUX. We worked in the same coworking space early last year.

He wanted some help with his new app on the email funnel side of things, so I worked with him for a week or so making a pretty giant email strategy—segmentation, custom sequences, etc.—that can be implemented within Drip.

### Siempo
Siempo, then called “Ebb,” was a project that I got roped into by Matthew Smith. I made the trek to Greenville and helped out with a strategy and planning workshop for the new minimalist phone. Here’s an excerpt from the website to give you an idea of what it’s all about:

>Siempo is the first mindful phone that limits distractions, without compromising access to the modern services that we depend on - including synced contacts and calendar, group messaging and wifi tethering. Siempo is the only phone designed with your best intentions in mind, helping you be more focused, present and fulfilled.

After the workshop, I was tasked with coming up with new operating system design concept based on a “single-field input” concept that we talked through during our workshop.

I designed some wireframes, UI designs, and made a few detailed animations of how the new operating system could work. No small task. I still haven’t been able to show all of the designs and animations, since they want to wait for their kickstarter campaign to launch before revealing too much. Here’s a little preview...

![siempo]()

**video review***

It was definitely some of the coolest work I did interaction and animation-wise last year.

### 12Stone Church
12Stone is a large multi-campus church in the southeast and they reached out to me to help them with a new mobile app. This was quite a large project and was a lot of fun to work on. The 12Stone crew were great to work with.

![12stone iPhone designs]()
 
### SuperFriendly
In the spring I spoke at Generate Conference along side Dan Mall  and others. Dan and we had lunch together and he mentioned a project that was coming up that might be good for us to work together on.

A few months passed and the project finally got teed up. I had the pleasure of working with Dan, Brad and Ian Frost, and Josh Clark during the 2-3 month project. 

We designed and built a pretty gigantic design system for Exxon Mobile. Josh Clark wrote a pretty big case study here, so I'll direct you to that instead of writing my own recap.

I had an amazing time working with the team. We moved fast and furiously and got an enormous amount of work done. I got to put my coding skills to work, almost exclusively, for the last 2 or 3 weeks. So much fun.

Here’s a bird’s eye view of the UI component design file.
![bird’s eye view]()
 
### New MDS
At some point during the year, I got super motivated to design a new site for myself. I’d been using the default Ghost theme, with a custom hard-coded navigation for the last couple of years and was getting really tired of it. So, I designed a new site (in the browser) for myself and chopped it all up into a Ghost template. I wrote a lot more about it [here](/particle).

As of today, I'm already dissatisfied with my current site design. I want to redesign again, but it's not a priority at the moment.

### Case Basis
A friend of mine in Athens, Jacob Thomason, put me in touch with a lawyer based in Augusta who had an idea for a mobile app that automated much of the personal injury case process. I’m always up for a random, real-world design challenge and put together a big interactive prototype for them to use as a part of their pitch to would be investors and partners.

The project went pretty smoothly and it looks like we’ll be designing the full app pretty soon.

### Analog Devices, Inc.
Analog reached out to me for iPhone app design, a user portal design, and a marketing site design. They also needed front-end development for the web pieces. I hired Phil Goodwin and Greg Corby to help me out on the design and dev front due to the size of the project. Things went nice and smooth.👌

I can’t share much about the product due to the NDA, but just know that it was a complex problem to solve and it was a lot of fun doing it. This was the first project I used Adobe XD entirely for the wireframes and flows.

### MyMonero
Monero is a cryptocurrency. It’s like bitcoin, but uses an entirely different code-base. I’m still a little foggy on all of the nerdy details of cryptocurrency in general, but in short Monero is much more fungible, and truly untraceable, unlike Bitcoin.

The idea behind Monero is that it is _truly_ **digital cash**. The same way you can look a $20 bill and not know all the places it’s been.

*MyMonero* is a digital wallet for sending and receiving Monero. I worked directly with Paul Shapiro, partner at MyMonero and the lead developer on the desktop app. Super fun project that stretched my problem solving skills on a whole new level. Paul is also a really great guy to work with.

You can see a lot more of the [designs here on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/mds/projects/465955-MyMonero).

### Adobe Live
In mid-December I got invited to join Adobe Live in San Francisco to show off some of Adobe XD’s features while designing an app “on the air.” Lots of fun hanging with the Adobe crew! [Here’s a post all about the 3-day session](/live-prototyping-with-xd).

![app design with xd]()

### Adjunct Professor at the University of GA
I taught my first higher-education class during the fall semester at the University of GA. The class was in the Graphic Design school, where _they still don’t **any** digital design-type classes_. There were some students who had little experience with the web and product design, but overall not so much.

I had them all go through the AIUX course for the first half of the semester coupled with in class sessions every week. The last half was dedicated to helping the students with a final project using user personas, user flows, wireframes, UI designs, and such for a design project of their choice.

I guess I can now officially call myself Professor Smith. 😉

### Books
I read a lot of books last year. [I made this page](/reading) to keep track of them all, _and future ones too_.
 
------------------------------------------------------------
 
## Conferences
I believe conferences are a vital part of my work. Especially as an independent designer that doesn’t live in a giant tech hub like San Francisco or New York.

Conferences, both attending and speaking, provide me amazing opportunity to make friends with people all of the world. Good relationships are the single greatest factor of running a successful business, and conferences are an amazing way to forge friendships with the other-wise online-only world.

Here are the ones I went to in 2016.
 
- **Epicurrence No. 3** – Attended my second conference hosted by Dann Petty. It was amazing. Super pumped to head to E5 next month.
- **Generate Conf** – Spoke at Generate in New York and had a blast. You can see the talk [here](https://youtu.be/o2xeQBJUeEA).
- **Creative South** – A super fun conference in my state. Driving distance is always good. Will I see you here in 2017? 
- **Adobe MAX** – My first-time attending MAX and it was a lot of fun. I co-lead a pre conference workshop teaching the ins and outs of Adobe XD. I also lead three other icon design workshops using Illustrator. Speaking of, I’ve got a free icon design course coming out based on this workshop.

---

### New Office
In March of 2016, Mattox Shuler and myself found a new office for our collective businesses in the Leathers Building just behind downtown Athens. It’s super rad. Kyle Key also joins us from time to time. 

Fast forward to the time of this writing and we've gotten an even newer, bigger space that I'll write about later.

### Sound Booth Build
The new office was super echoey due to the massive amount of concrete, brick, and glass. I leveled up my 3D design and carpentry skills to make this custom sound booth for our office. It cuts down on echo dramatically for things like phone and video calls plus it’s great little place to [record tutorials, vlogs, and such](http://youtube.com/mattdsmith). 

### Vlogging
After Dann Petty paid me a visit while shooting his FR$$LANCED film last year, I kind of got the itch to start doing some video myself. I had already created video tutorials, but only using Screenflow for screen recordings and my crappy iSight camera. 

I did a lot of research on a good, but not too crazy of a price,  camera that I could use in a small space for my continued design tutorials, as well as something I could use on the go, to practice filming and editing chops.

I ended up going with a Sony a6300 along with some other items. [You can see all of my video gear here](http://kit.com/mds/video-gear).

### Half Marathon
The AthHalf, is an annual event in the city I live, and every year over the past few I’ve thought, “I’d really like to run that thing.” 13.1 miles is way longer of a distance than I’ve ever ran before, but I was tired of just simply not doing it.

I had been strength training for most of the year until around June, and decided to start running more seriously. After chatting with a few folks and looking up some training programs, I got to work.

I was ecstatic to run in the event and ended up beating my goal time by over 15 minutes. Not a fast run relative to “fast runners,” but it was very fast for me. You can [view the full details on Strava](http://strava.com).

### Family Vacation in San Diego
Though I’ve lived in Georgia my entire life, I have some family that lives on the West Coast near the bay area. In June of last year my wife and I bit the bullet and purchased cross-county plane tickets for ourselves and our four kids.

We flew into San Diego and rented different Airbnbs throughout our 2-week trip. First we stayed in Carlsbad, then San Diego, then Encinitas. 

The timing worked out perfectly for me. I had just wrapped up the 12Stone project as we were leaving for the trip and the next one with Dan and SuperFriendly was starting right at the end of the 2-weeks.

This trip with my family to California for 2 weeks was absolutely the highlight of the year. We’ve _got_ to travel more as a family.

### New Car
My Honda Element’s transmission started slipping and showing its age, so I did what any aging married man with 4 kids would do and started looking for sporty cars.

The sportiest I could find that could still fit up to 4 kids (barely) and not break the bank, but still look super cool and have a manual transmission, was a Nissan Juke. I did lots of searching around my area and found a Nismo RS up in Asheville. 

### Rubik’s Cube
Taught myself and my two oldest kids how to solve the Rubik’s Cube last year.

One of my goal’s for this year was to solve it in under a minute. I just so happened to crush that goal on New Year’s Day while my son was watching. He previously had a faster time for me, so it felt good to get my name back on the family leaderboard. ;) 

### My Family
My family is and continues to be my number one priority. It’s still tricky to balance work, conferences, new projects, etc. But above all I want to prioritize my time with my wife and kids.

Sometimes that means putting in extra work to buy us more time in the future. So in the short term it might not look that way. As long as I can remember the ultimate goal and stay disciplined with my time, I'm confident this can be effective.

It's no easy task to continually be in agreement with your spouse about how you spend your time. Especially when you have a business to run and 4 kids to raise and a wife you want to spend time with. But, it's critical to be on the same page.

Each year, I feel we get better at this. So here's to the next year with my beautiful family!

# 3 Illustrator Wireframes for Your Next Responsive Web Design Project

It can be difficult for a client to understand which screen design is which if you present your work without device context. Below is an example that shows the high-level wireframe layout for three major breakpoints.

![web page one](/content/images/2014/12/responsive_home.png)
![web page two](/content/images/2014/12/responsive_vessels.png)
![web page three](/content/images/2014/12/responsive_vessel-detail.png)

These aren't meant to be the governing authority on breakpoints that should be used within the final product, but rather a quick tool for helping sell your work, which is often just as important as the work itself.

If you can put together some wireframes like this to help tell the story of your responsive designs and get quick buy in from the client, then that's a huge early win that can help move the project in the right direction. This is also a great way to get on the same page with the developer, who can let you know quickly if he or she sees any potential problems with your design.

Last week my friend, Colin, tweeted that he'd be posting on his blog everyday for the next thirty days. I immediately thought that I should do the same as my blog's gotten a bit dusty over the last few months.

How could I possibly continue my unintentional blog hiatus after I've been summoned to a contest of skill, strength, etc.

Colin, thanks for the kick in the pants. Challenge accepted.

# 5 Watches on My Shortlist

![watch](/content/images/2014/Sep/watch.jpg)

About 6 months ago I slung my backpack over my shoulder and my [watch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZB7FJG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002ZB7FJG&linkCode=as2&tag=madsm-20&linkId=UIKZZUXJRXX7SOJL) got snagged and hit the pavement. I've wanted to get a replacement ever since, but haven't made it a priority.

With Apple's Watch announcement yesterday, suddenly I'm thinking about watches again. Here are a few that I've had on my shortlist to replace my busted Phosphor.

**1. Skagen Ancher Men's Steel Mesh Watch**

I love the flat black color and finish of the face and band. The small red accent on the second hand is a nice touch too.

![skagen watch](/content/images/2014/Sep/skagen.png)

You can find this watch [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BLZWI5S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BLZWI5S&linkCode=as2&tag=madsm-20&linkId=5P4YVXZAJNHOENTC)

**2. Braun Men's Classic Mesh Analog Display Quartz Black Watch** 

This Braun is similar to the Skagen above, but has more of a classic feel to it with more details on the face, including numbers and minute marks.

![braun watch](/content/images/2014/Sep/braun.png)

Check out the Braun [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X4KW7A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004X4KW7A&linkCode=as2&tag=madsm-20&linkId=CVW2HYJXBMZAZSYY).

**3. AÃRK Iconic Graphite**

This watch has a chunky military style about it with strong bevels on edges and geometric indentions on the face. There's something so appealing about the black on black on black. It's not for everyone, but I'm a sucker for this style.

![watch](/content/images/2014/Sep/iconicgraphite01.jpg)

Check out lots more pictures and info [here](http://aarkcollective.com/products/iconic/iconic-graphite)


**4. Nixon - The Corporal**

My youngest son's name is [Nixon](http://mattdsmith.com/nixon) so I"m partial to the brand, although the company name wasn't the influence for his. Nonetheless, this is another stealthy-looking watch with the subtle face, black on black - love it.

![watch](/content/images/2014/Sep/nixon_corporal.png)

You can find The Corporal [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZV06EK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004ZV06EK&linkCode=as2&tag=madsm-20&linkId=GUNR4OQ2I65EB2KP)

**5. Apple Watch**

Last but not least, the Apple Watch was finally announced. They've covered a huge range of styles, but again, I'm partial to the black on black. This one is the 42mm Space Gray Aluminum Case with the Black Sport Band. You can easily spend more the $300 on a high quality watch, so with the current price point of $349 on this new watch from Apple, it just may take the cake for me. With a built in heart rate monitor, among tons of other features, it's hard to say no to this.

Sure, it may be annoying to get text messages on your wrist, but you're a big boy, turn them off. 

![watch](/content/images/2014/Sep/apple_watch.png)

Stare in awe at the [Apple Watch](http://apple.com/watch)

---

Now that I've gone 6 months without a watch, I feel pretty good about waiting out the Apple Watch release and seeing how it all plays out in 2015.

# #663399Becca


I've never met [Eric Meyer](https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/475423495178838016), but my oldest son is 6 and the thought of losing him crushes me. 

When people started changing their avatars purple, I silently thought to myself, *"What good is that going to do? Why would you do that if you didn't even know them?"*

Then I quickly remembered all the times I've shouldered burdens with my family and friends - who've done the same for me. Just knowing that someone *feels* for you, has compassion for you, it helps. In a tiny way, it helps.

Reading this excerpt from [Eric's latest post](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/10/so-many-nevers/) captures so much heartbreak.

>My beautiful, bright-burning girl, my little spark.  I wanted so much to watch you grow and learn, and to see the world made new through your eyes.  I would do almost anything to restore all that to you.  Give you my own years, if I could. 

If you see purple avatars popping up today, June 12 2014, and you've read this post, go ahead and make your avatar purple. *If you don't know how to do that, you can download this [psd](http://mds.io/W1rK) and replace my avatar with yours - or just use [this purple image](http://mds.io/W2Gc).*

Then tweet out [#663399Becca](https://twitter.com/mattrobin140s/status/476109575532601344). 

It won't do much, but imagine the Meyer family scrolling through the hashtag search and seeing an ocean of supporters who they don't even know. For a tiny moment, it will bring Eric and his family warmth.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>So many of you are purple-fying your avatars that I’ve been moved to do the same. Thank you all so, so much.</p>&mdash; Eric A. Meyer (@meyerweb) <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb/statuses/476800227525922816">June 11, 2014</a></blockquote>

# AIUX Private Alpha

<iframe src='https://spoken.co/t/2478337/embed' frameborder='0' width='100%' height='84'></iframe>

Friday wasn’t very productive on the [AIUX](/aiux) front. I got a late start on the day and only managed to record one video. I recorded it multiple times, but still didn’t quite get it right. I realize now after creating a total of 4 of the videos, I need to add a little more structure to make sure there’s a good beginning, middle, and end. Aristotle would be proud.

I knew that I didn’t want them to be 100% scripted so they didn’t come across dry and mechanical. Since I didn’t want a script I opted for writing a short description of the videos as a bare minimum. This isn’t enough to create an effective video. Today I’ll be implementing an outline of sorts to each video. Something like this:

1. Introduction of the video topic and what problem it solves. (Beginning)
2. In-depth topic coverage and *how-to* problem solving. (Middle)
3. Reiteration of the problem, how we solved it, and the benefits that come from solving it. Issue homework to be completed before the next video. (End)

> "A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end." -Aristotle

This should provide more clarity and better structure for the next videos I produce. Assuming this technique works well, I’ll go back and rerecord the existing ones.

## Private Beta
~~I’m going to setup a *private beta group* for testing the course’s pilot videos. I want to get early feedback on their effectiveness and incorporate any necessary modifications before the course goes live. If you’re interested in learning rapid responsive UX design with Adobe Illustrator and are willing to provide constructive criticism along the way, then I invite you to get early behind-the-scenes access to the course content as it’s being created. There will be a **limited number** of private alpha members so make sure you sign up quickly.~~

The private beta was a smashing success. [Get notified the next time the course goes live](https://rwd.aiux.co).

# How to Create Animated Dribbble Shots

![keyboard animation](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/6410/screenshots/1535502/finger-placement.gif)

"How did you create that animation?" This is a question I get a lot on [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/mds) as well as inbound email inquiries from curious minds alike. After responding individually to a dozen or so people, I figured I should write out my process for future reference.

## TL;DR
1. Animate in Flash
2. Export as `.mov`
3. Import Video Frames as Layers in Photoshop
4. Save as `.gif`
5. Done

Animation won't save a poorly executed design. It will only reveal its crappiness. Make sure you spend the proper amount of time getting your idea and pixels just right before jumping into animation. Design is the cornerstone for a great animation.

Once you have realized a great design, animation can really give it a little bump up to [11](http://mds.io/V1Yt). Animation is good for communicating interaction ideas, transitions, etc. and I've found that a simple animation can go a long way when it comes to explaining your ideas to coworkers and clients.

## Flash is Dead, but I Still Use It
Flash might be *dead* as far as web publishing goes (except for video, games, copy and paste buttons, etc.), but it's still a valuable and powerful animation tool.

**Disclaimer:** The only reason I use Flash is because that is how I started back in the day and still know the software fairly well. It's what I'm most comfortable animating with. If you know After Effects, use that. Keynote junkie? Use that. The key is, use what you're comfortable with. The software doesn't really matter.

I import my psd, or pieces of it, into Flash and create a timeline based animation. If you do use flash, all of the animation needs to be on the root timeline with no nested animations. This is because you need to export a `.mov` and exporting this format only captures root level animation.

Flash exports gifs, but the quality is pretty bad. When you're done with the animation, export it as a `.mov` file instead. If you're interested in a quick and simple Flash animation tutorial let [me](http://twitter.com/mds) know and perhaps one day your wildest dream will come true. Until then, here's a high speed video showing how to create simple animations.

## Back to Photoshop
After the animated `.mov` is exported, crack Photoshop open, go to File > Import > Video frames to layers. It's kind of mind blowing that this is possible.

This creates lots of layers in your document *and* creates a frame animation in your timeline. Choose File > Window > Timeline and you'll see how all of the frames are already in place based on your mov. To make sure your gif never stops, set it to *Forever* if it's not already.

Once this is done, *Save for Web* as a `.gif` and you're all set!

Here's a video showing a quick animation done in Flash.

# ARGD 4190

<style>.mds-form-container, .mds-announcement { display: none; }</style>

Welcome to the online syllabus for your class with Matt D. Smith. This page will serve as our  project plan and maybe updated throughout the semester.

Our focus will be completing the AIUX video course and a final project.

[View Class Schedule and such](http://mds.io/hCnM)

## Course Objectives
- to broaden familiarity with the design profession as it relates to User Experience Design, Responsive Web Design, Mobile Design. 
- to gain an understanding of basic business practices
- to improve skills in communication about design–especially your own design work–both verbally and written

## Course Requirements:
- Complete all scheduled assignments, meet deadlines, and participation in discussions.
- Watch and complete all AIUX lessons.
- Exude attendance and professionalism.
- Positive attitude, professionalism and clear communication.
- Complete all final course documentation requirements per instructions.

## Class Structure
*Mondays* will be in-person in the classroom and *Wednesdays* will be held remotely.  

There will be assigned AIUX lessons for the entire class related to each week’s topic, but one or two students will be assigned as discussion leaders on that topic to pose relevant questions and lead conversation.

Until further notice, we'll use our class time as follows:

- **Mondays**:  *design review* and group discussion day
- **Wednesdays**:  virtual working day via [Slack](http://slack.com)

[Email me](http://mds.is/me/#contact), if you're not setup with Slack yet or got lost somehow.

## Class etiquette and attendance
Attendance is mandatory.

Because we only meet in-person once per week, missing class will be detrimental to your understanding of the material and your grade. More than one absence affects your grade. More than two absences results in being dropped from the course with a grade of F. Two tardies equals one absence.

No food in class (per UGA Policy). Drinks must have secure lids. Do not answer or make calls or texts during class time. Turn your cell phone on silent. If you use your phone during a group discussion, critique, lecture or presentation; thus, will effect your final grade.

## Assessment:
Your work should exhibit clear communication in both its visual and written components. Writing skills are invaluable to designers and potential employers. Your final grade will be based on a combination of your performance related to:

- Assignments
- Participation in class discussions
- Professionalism /Class Etiquette
- Writing Quality
- Timeliness with Attendance and Class Work
- Collaboration (when necessary)

An A grade necessitates: Full engagement in class discussions, offering thoughtful comments and questions (obviously completes all reading and assignments in a timely fashion). Turn in all assignments on time and in excellent condition. Completed AIUX course. In-person and virtual attendance.

# Artboards or InDesign?

![artboards or indesign](/content/images/2014/Feb/ai_or_id-2.jpg)

Since publishing [Wireframing with Illustrator and InDesign](http://mattdsmith.com/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/) I've gotten lots of questions about the *why* behind the process.

**Why not use artboards in Illustrator rather than using InDesign and individual .ai files?** This was the most popular question so here's a breakdown for you.

## Reasons Not To Use Artboards
- Artboards don't have page numbers. InDesign does.
- Artboards can't have master element templates. InDesign does.
- Artboards become unmanageable if you need to move pages around or make lots of revisions to your existing flow. This is easy with InDesign.
- Artboards can get misaligned very easily even if it's just a few pixels. There's nothing more annoying that flipping through a pdf of similar pages and have things shifting here and there on ever page. It just looks unprofessional and not polished. This is easy to prevent with InDesign.
- Artboards are a mess for large projects with 20+ pages.

These aren't exhaustive reasons, but rather my preferences. InDesign is great for large client projects like apps, etc. Not so much for a marketing site, or a simple little app.

## Reasons To Use Artboards

Artboards are way faster than doing the InDesign thing. If you don't have a good reason to use it, don't. If presentation quality isn't an issue for whatever reason, save yourself some trouble and use artboards. I do.

If you've designed a whole sequence of screens (10-12) in a row and want to share them with someone use Artboards. In these moments I'm much less concerned with looking polished for a presentation. I just want someone to see check out my digital whiteboard and give me their thoughts.

To do that create an artboard around the sequence by clicking "Document Setup" in the top bar.

![top bar](/content/images/2014/Feb/topbar.png)

Then "Edit Artboards"

![edit artboards](/content/images/2014/Feb/edit_artboards.png)

Click and drag an artboard around your sequence of screens. Or you can resize the existing artboard.

![draw artboard](/content/images/2014/Feb/artboard.png)

Finally, save that as a pdf with *using artboards* selected.

![save artboard as pdf](/content/images/2014/Feb/save_as_pdf.png)

## Closing Thoughts
To sum it all up, I'd say for larger projects that need super polished presentation, use the [Illustrator and InDesign process](http://mattdsmith.com/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/).  Create a nice template or modify mine and let your work shine.

If you're working on a smaller project and don't see the point, trust your gut and go with what makes sense for you. Artboards can be great for that and InDesign can be overkill.

The technique is less important than accomplishing your task at hand. Think more about the problem you're trying to solve rather than what tools would be the best.

Now, go wireframe all the things!

# Athens Made Round 2

*This will make more sense if you read [this post](http://mattdsmith/athens-made) first.*

The logo competition for [Athensmade.com](http://athensmade.com) is over. Sort of. There's a twist. Two of the logos were neck and neck during the wee hours of January 15th, so a sudden death match of sorts is now upon us. 

It was my logo and two others. I guess I didn't campaign hard enough or offer enough free pizzas. 

Here is the official email:

>Matt - 

>Thank you for participating in the Athens Made Logo contest!  It turned out to be a much larger success than we even imagined bringing in nearly 1500 votes between the top 3 logos alone!  Impressive!

>The top 3 logos were incredibly close in voting as well.  As a result, it is difficult to determine a clear favorite that would represent Athens.

>We’d like to have the top 3 logos go into a run off.  In order to equally represent all three logos, we’re asking you to please submit the following:

>- All logos in black and white (no color)
- Small scale version of the logo at 32px x 32px
- Larger size version at 200px x 200px
- Optionally send over 3 product shots.  These would feature your logo how it would potentially be shown on company products.

>By submitting these items we hope to feature all logos in the same light for a final run off. 

>Please submit these additions by Monday, January 20th at 5PM. 

>At that point, we'll have the top ten brands in Athens (such as Jittery Joe's, Your Pie, etc - companies that would use the brand) vote for their favorite.  

>We will pick a winner from this group by Friday, January 24th. 

>If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.  

>Thanks!

I still have my beef with logo competitions in general, but understand the heart of the matter here so I'm willing to continue cooperating.

My biggest concern is that 10 companies voting on a logo, just sounds like a few too many cooks in the proverbial kitchen. I'm not there to give the pitch on what makes my design work, how it can be incorporated into existing brands, etc. It's a big toss up based on 10 different business owner's personal tastes, as opposed to a professional designer-led process.

I outlined this in more detail in my [previous post](http://mattdsmith/athens-made), but the thing to remember here is context. Context is king. The context for this logo is to represent Athens, GA businesses, products, artists, entrepreneurs, companies, and general things that are *made in Athens*. It's an initiative to bring unity, visibility, and exposure to our city.

The mark needs to be strong but not overpowering. It needs to be recognizable but not distracting. It needs to be unique but paired well with others. It's a sort of chameleon brand, since the goal is to have Athens made products incorporate the mark onto their products, website footer, etc. It's of the utmost importance that these companies (mine included) actually *want* to put the mark on their products.

So here is my round 2 submission. A small logo 32px. A smallish/medium sized logo at 200px, as well as 3 product shots from Athens-based business. I chose Jittery Joe's Coffee, Terrapin Brewery, and Your Pie (pizzeria).

## Updated Logo Sizes
*32px*
![athens made 32px](/content/images/2014/Jan/_athensmade_32_mds.jpg)

*200px*
![athens made 200px](/content/images/2014/Jan/_athensmade_200_mds.jpg)


## Product Shots

*Jittery Joe's*
![athens made jittery joes](/content/images/2014/Jan/athensmade_jitteryjoes_mds.jpg)

Subtly placed on the back of the cup holder. Not in your face, but noticeable upon inspection.

*Terrapin*
![athens made terrapin](/content/images/2014/Jan/athensmade_terrapin_mds.jpg)

Same here. On the back in a discreet yet findable location.

*Your Pie*
![athens made your pie](/content/images/2014/Jan/athensmade_yourpie_mds.jpg)

I would have chosen a better location than the front of the cup for this one, but this is the best product shot I could find after digging through Flickr and Google Images. Ideally it would be on the inside of a pizza box, or the back of a cup.

Under normal circumstances, I would never enter a logo contest. But I feel this has special merit that beckons me to bend my moral compass. I want to see my city represented with a great mark that can stand the test of time.

That's a wrap for now. I'll write another follow up post once the results are in.

# Athens Made Branding

A few months ago a handful of people had the idea for  [athensmade.com](http://athensmade.com), an initiative to create an identity for products, companies, etc. hailing from the classic city. It's been a seed of an idea for some time now and it's finally picking up steam.

Here's an excerpt from the website:
>Our city has long been known as a hub of creativity – music, art, food, film & theatre. We are also the home of the University of Georgia, college football, and a downtown renowned for its vibrant night life.  Unfortunately, not many people can tell you about all of the amazing companies that have been built in Athens that provide jobs, stability and a growing local economy.

>We can do better. And, in the process, make Athens better. The individuals who have chosen to make Athens home have created vibrant, innovative and game-changing companies that provide thousands of jobs for citizens, stimulate the local, regional and national economy and provide the underpinnings of what makes Athens great.

I've lived in Athens for over 10 years and think that "Athens Made" is a great idea. I've always loved Athens, but in 2013 with the launch of Transform Athens, I've really discovered my passion for the city.

However, I'm not big on logo competitions like Athens Made, because I believe design is leadership. And design leadership requires one person at the helm. 

Design needs to be packaged and sold in a specific way with a huge regard to context. Designing for a project should be akin to a sniper rifle, not a shotgun.

But, despite all this, Athens is my city and I want to see it represented in the best possible way. So I'm tabling my competition woes for another time.

It's impossible to express the ins and outs of a brand, it's mark, and the possible usages in a simple image upload, jumbled with dozens of others. So here is a quick breakdown of the mark I submitted and the logic behind the design.

## The Problem
Bringing attention and unity to the businesses and professionals in the city is the problem at hand. There are many success stories but there is much fragmentation among them, so the problem is a single unifying thread that ties each together, to create synergy. Yes, I just used that word.

## The Challenge
Athens *is* a diverse city packed with UGA students, musicians, professionals, an eclectic downtown scene, an art-centric culture, and much more. There are lots of businesses in town - Jittery Joe's Coffee, 1000 Faces Coffee, Terrapin Beer, Fire and Flavor, Tifosi Optics, Your Pie, and many more.

The biggest challenge is to create an "Athens Made" mark that can be incorporated into each of these companies, as well as hundreds of others not listed. The mark needs to be recognizable but adaptable to existing brands. It needs to be strong but not overpowering. It needs to be easily incorporated into the footer of any of the Athens company websites without being distracting.

In other words, it needs to be a simple mark that business actually *want* to put on their business's product - be it a website, laser engraved on a product, or printed on a coffee cup. It *must* adapt well in any number of colors, sizes, etc.

## The Solution
I began thinking through the problem and challenges behind the Athens Made initiative, and how it could best be solved. There's a big craft and hand-made culture here so I thought it could be nice to represent that with a hand-lettered logotype. I started, as always with some sketching.

![sketches 1](/content/images/2014/Jan/sketches4.jpg)

![sketches 2](/content/images/2014/Jan/sketches3.jpg)

Now I'm not great at hand-lettering so I didn't feel like these were going in a good direction, nor did I feel that yet another script-like logo was unique enough for a strong and simple mark. So I went back to the drawing board.

![sketches 3](/content/images/2014/Jan/sketches2.jpg)

![sketches 4](/content/images/2014/Jan/sketches1.jpg)

This felt like a better direction with a more simplistic approach. It's much harder to create a strong and simple mark than a busy and complex one. Plus this needed to be iconic and paired with other brands as a primary usage. A busy or illustrative design for the mark has huge potential to clash and or detract from the businesses that would incorporate the mark into their own brand's material.

![vectorized marks](/content/images/2014/Jan/vectorized.png)

I started to vectorize the mark I felt worked best as a sketch. From there I created multiple versions quickly to test the weight and contrast. It's also important to keep in mind that this mark may end up being super tiny as an add-on, on the back of someone's packaging, so it's a must that it work at a very small size.

This is the final mark I settled on. 

![final mark](/content/images/2014/Jan/final.jpg)

![stacked grid](/content/images/2014/Jan/am_grid_stacked.jpg)

![stacked](/content/images/2014/Jan/am_stacked.jpg)

![horizontal grid](/content/images/2014/Jan/am_grid_horizontal.jpg)

![horizontal](/content/images/2014/Jan/am_horizontal.jpg)

These captured all of the attributes I felt necessary for this type of project. Strong and iconic, and works well when the size is drastically reduced. It's a type of chameleon brand that needs to be adaptive to its surroundings.

Proposed method for typesetting:
![type](/content/images/2014/Jan/athensmade_type.jpg)
Using _Athensmade_ as a full and complete word, establishes the phrase as a singular reference for the initiative as a whole. In a way, unifying the words "Athens" and "made" symbolizes the unity between the entrepreneurs, business, artists, products, etc. I don't want to get too philosophical about it, but I do like the idea.  

Here it is paired with other Athens-based company brands.

_Jittery Joe's Coffee_
![jittery joes](/content/images/2014/Jan/am_0000_jittery.jpg)

_1000 Faces Coffee_

_Fire and Flavor_

_Your Pie_

_Tifosi Optics_

_Ciamillo Components_

_Four Athens_

_Rentpost_

_Possible website footer implementation_

![dot com](/content/images/2014/Jan/am_dotcom.jpg)


## The Results
The voting on the site is currently open until January 15, 2014. The information isn't super specific on whether or not the total number of votes will determine the winning logo, or one will be chosen.

It says:
>"Voting goes through Jan 15th. The chosen logo will be awarded $1,000."

I care much more about the representation of our city than $1,000, and that is my motivation for writing this post. So hopefully this will help inform the logic behind the concept.

In the meantime, if what I've designed and pitched has resonated with you, go to [Athens Made](http://athensmade.com) and vote for my logo, by first selecting the logo and then selecting the  green check mark in the dark button.

I'm happy to announce that my logo was declared the winner after the final round of voting for [Athensmade](http://athensmade.com). To commemorate the project, we're selling an [Athensmade t-shirt on Cotton Bureau](https://cottonbureau.com/products/athensmade). All proceeds of the shirt (beyond CB's expenses) will go towards outfitting the new coworking space in downtown Athens at the Bottleworks. The space is slated to open March 1 - more details on that later.

For more details on the logo competition, checkout [Athens Made Round 2](http://mattdsmith.com/athens-made-round-2) and the [concept behind my original design](http://mattdsmith.com/athens-made).  

The final logos in the run-off were presented to 10 prominent Athens-based businesses for voting. Once the [results were in](https://twitter.com/athensmade/status/426859266281328640) I put together an *Athensmade 2014 Logo Usage Guidelines* document and exported all of the variations for the general public to use.

The brand assets and usage guidelines are now available for download at [athensmade.com](http://athensmade.com). Here's a look at the guidelines I put together.

# Back from Craft and Commerce

<figure><img src="/content/images/2017/06/IMG_1537.JPG" alt="Excuses are tools of the tools of incompetence. This whole specialize in them, are seldom good at anything else—nicole walters" /><figcaption>The amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/napturalnicole">Nicole Walters</a> at the ConverKit conference.</figcaption
</figure>

You're going to have to focus if you're going to build something meaningful. Doing a thing every once in a while isn't going to cut it. It might make you feel good, but it won't have any lasting impact.

FYI, this is totally a reminder to myself, but perhaps you need to hear it too.

---

I just got back from the first annual [Craft and Commerce](https://convertkit.com/conference/) conference put on by ConvertKit in Boise, ID.

My biggest take away was "**do the actual work**."

Deep, I know. But bare with me...

Put your head down and write that post or book. Make that video. Do that thing that you've been thinking about. But above all BE consistent.

It's tempting to get wrapped up in tips and tricks and secrets of success, but THERE ARE NO SECRETS. That's the simple truth. 

Motivation is fun. Motivation makes you feel good, but it's nothing but a multiplier. Motivation is potential energy, not actual energy.

I left the conference feeling incredibly inspired and motivated, but I also want to give myself a giant slap in the face—pull myself down to reality and start shaking myself by the shoulders. I want to throw myself into a cold shower and make myself TRULY TRULY TRULY grasp the fact that nothing that I do will make an impact unless I CONSISTENTLY do the work.

Not planning for the work. Not thinking about the work. Not imagining what life would be like if the work was done. Not being overwhelmed by the work, but ACTUALLY DOING IT. Consistently.

My foray into [YouTube videos](http://youtube.com/mdsis) has been fun and all and people have even been so kind to tell me that they're getting value out of them. But my strategy has never been very strategic.

I told myself I'd publish 2 videos per week this year, but you know what... 

That's not good enough by itself. I even put together a lofty "film on this day and edit on this day and publish on this day" kind of half-assed plan. NO. That just doesn't work.

I've got to get it together more than that. And for me, just like so many others at the conference, needs to start with building a writing habit. And guess what?

YOU CAN'T BUILD A WRITING HABIT UNLESS YOU'RE WRITING REGULARLY.

It's so freaking common sense it hurts. But that's the simple truth. The key is focusing on the starting line instead of the finish line. Something James Clear so eloquently weaved into his talk at the conference.

![James Clear](/content/images/2017/06/IMG_6898.JPG)

The finish line is overwhelming to the think about when you feel unprepared for the race. And the finish line keeps moving as you  get started. It always changes.

The finish line is when you die. That's morbid, but it's the truth. So pull your head out of your self-loathing ass and get to freaking work.

For me that is going to be writing daily and publishing weekly. I'm almost scared to "say that out loud" for all to read because there's a voice in my head that's saying...

>"You will fail, Matt. You've tried writing regularly before and you couldn't keep it up. Look at what you did with your videos, you said you were gonna post twice per week and you've barely been able to do one per week. Don't post a declaration about what you're going to do, because you'll be even more embarrassed when you fail again. And you know you'll fail again, because that's what you do.

To that I say, "EFF YOU, VOICE." You are not helpful. I will not listen to your whiny excuse-laden self. You have nothing to do with my plans, goals, and aspirations. You provide zero value to me and I will not allow you to influence my mind in any way. I will put you outside while I write, film, edit, and consistently DO THE WORK.

Then and only then will I let you come back in. And when you try to bring me your B.S. about me not doing it, I'll say "look you sad son-of-a-biscuit eater, here's all the work I did while you were out there moping around." 

Time waits for no one.

Anyone standing on top of a mountain didn't fall there. They freaking climbed it. And climbing isn't easy.

Laying on the couch is *easy*. Watching TV every night for 2 hours is *easy*. Sleeping in until the last possible minute is *easy*. Complaining you don't have time is *easy*. Allowing yourself to believe that it's easy for someone else is *easy*. Excusing yourself from doing the work because you feel resistance is *easy*. Making excuses is *easy*.

It's time to shake off *easy*.

It's time to feel the resistance, acknowledge it and press in. It's *hard* to wake up early and write for an hour—CONSISTENTLY. It's *hard* to go to sleep by 10pm so you can wake up at 4:30am to put in the work AND do the workout AND take care of your normal duties throughout the day. It's *hard* to manage that when you have kids that wake up early. It's *hard* to not be selfish about your time when it's pulled in so many ways. It's *hard* to refrain from opening up Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, every time you feel a quick sense of boredom.

Deliberate practice is hard work, but that's where the brain is changed. I'm [currently reading](/reading) an incredible book called, *[Grit](http://amzn.to/2rYlS1F)*, that goes into tons of research about this.

When you push yourself beyond your current capabilities, that's when you become better. That's when you build. That's when the muscle in your body tears. That's when your brain regions become lit up and active. And slowly, yes SLOWLY, but **surely** you will see changes as you're consistent. 

So get on with it then...

That project, that idea, that thing you've been just dying to do. GO FREAKING DO IT. You will die soon and time doesn't give a shit about you. Unfollow everyone on Twitter if you have to. Unfollow me, stop reading this blog. If that's what's holding you back, if I'm a hindrance, then cut me out. Do your thing. Get after it and get it done. 

Make a grand gesture and refocus on what really matters to you. Don't do just a little more research. Don't check Twitter just one more time. Don't post a picture of you starting on Instagram. Don't even talk about it. Just do the incredibly unsexy work of getting started and getting to work.

And I'm not talking about your job. You don't get paid if you don't do your job. I'm talking about your art. That passionate thing that's living inside of you right now. You've got to get on that right away. You don't want to live with regret. You don't want to let that slip away forever.

---

Seth Godin was the closing speaker at the conference and as you may suspect, he was amazing. Near the end of his talk he said... (and I'm paraphrasing)

> You need to ignore almost everybody. The way you're gonna win is by targeting the smallest possible audience you can live with and serve them.

 Shana and I even got to meet him and take a picture.

# Back From the Beach

I just got back from Myrtle Beach with my family for our first ever vacation since having [four](/four) kids. We  had a great time despite our van’s AC going out on the 6 hour drive home while our 1 year old, [Nixon](/nixon), threw up multiple times all over himself and his carseat. Nothing like hot air and a pungent vomit smell to really cap off a good vacation. But, on a non-throwuppy note, you can see some of the good times had on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/p/3cY5fFDKHt/?taken-by=mds).

This vacation was a line of demarcation for me in a lot of ways. Last fall I started writing a lot about using Illustrator for UX design, which I very creatively called [AIUX](/aiux). This was a  [new thing](/doing-a-new-thing) for me, but at the start of 2015 I was really swamped with client work.

I had four different projects going on in January– two wrapping up and two starting taking up all of my time and then some for the first quarter. In the middle of all of that I also spoke at [Squares Conference](/real) and attended [Epicurrence](/daydreaming-of-epicurrence).

I used the extreme time constraint of so much client work as an unmovable excuse for my lack of follow through on my own AIUX project. Looking back, yes it was very very busy, but I know I could have published something once a week or every other week at least. Once the momentum from the previous fall had vanished, I gave into the excuses. Though I did design a typeface, which I’ll release soon.

Back to the line of demarcation though. I’m back from the beach and my client work is now intentionally *very* light. I’ve saved up some cash and said no to a bunch of projects that have come my way in the last month. I’m investing in myself for the remainder of June and July to put my head down and create my first AIUX online video course. Just like I mentioned on the [current AIUX page](/aiux), the course will be an in-depth look at using Illustrator for responsive UX design. It will be targeted at designers, developers, or anyone who has little to no responsive design experience and wants to gain a solid foundation for the strategy and tactics that go into a responsive design project.

The course will provide students a foundation for UX thinking behind design decisions across devices and the tactical Illustrator skills for creating and organizing this information in a fast and efficient way. This will be a big course that I’m dedicating a full 6+ weeks to creating. My goal is to have the beta version ready by August 1, 2015. From there I’ll invite a small number of people to enroll in the course for the first trial run. 

Will this work? I don’t know, but all of this information is what I’ve learned the hard way over the last decade and what I can condense into a solid process and workflow– one that has kept me in a successful independent consulting business for the last 7 years. I’m investing a ton of time and taking a big risk by continuing to deflect client work, but I can’t keep this as an idea any longer. It’s time to set it free. I’ll write more updates as I make progress.

Thanks for reading, and if you have any feedback or want to tell me I’m crazy, please do so. =)

# Essentialism

[![essentialism book](/content/images/2015/01/essentialism-01.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137382/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0804137382&linkCode=as2&tag=madsm-20&linkId=TWHQPTVWHYRNZK6G)
I just finished my fourth book since changing a key [habit](/habits) over Christmas a few weeks ago. *Essentialism*, a New York Times bestseller by Greg McKeown, dissects “the disciplined pursuit of less.” The book uncovers ways to focus less on the trivial many, and focus more on the vital few. This book is really good. One that I’ll be sure to read again. It’s a type of handbook for prioritizing your life and paying great attention to what really matters.

Here are some key sections I noted while reading:

>To discern what is truly essential we need space to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep, and the discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make.

That sounds fabulous, right? If we prioritized those things mentioned above, surely we’d all be better off. With this in mind, I’m trying to spend more time with my journal-slash-sketchbook. I’ve got to-do lists on my iPhone, MacBook, and more, but actually thinking through and clarifying a thought proves much more difficult with tiny distractions–notifications, email, little red dots, buzzes, blips, and rings. 

My notebook and pen don’t do anything. I’m either writing or thinking while wielding those tiny tools. Nothing else. This is crucial.

>Inspired by Newton, I took a similar, if perhaps less extreme, approach to writing this book. I blocked of eight hours a day to write: from 5:00 AM to 1:00 PM, five days a week (for 8 months). The basic rule was no email, no calls, no appointments, and no interruptions until after 1:00 PM. I didn’t always achieve it, but the discipline made a big difference. I set my email bounce back to explain that I was in “monk mode” until after the book was complete. It is difficult to overstate how much freedom I found in this approach.

“That’s great for him, Matt, but I’ve got a job and there’s no way I could do something like that.” That may be true, but their our ways to control our time. For example, I’ve started a habit to write for a minimum of 15 minutes each day when I turn my computer on for the first time. Some days I miss, but lots of days I don’t. Sometimes I write for 15 minutes and it's utter crap. Other days I get in the flow and go for an hour and write over 1,000 words. While I may not have 8 hours a day to work on a personal thing, I do have *some* time. So do you.

>When I ask people, “What do you *really* want out of your career over the next five years?” I am still taken aback by how few people can answer the question.

This one hit me in the gut. I have ambitions, some concrete some vague, but I can’t really answer that right now in a cohesive fashion. To the journal!

>So to remove the obstacle (you may have) you need to replace the idea “This has to be perfect or else” with “Done is better than perfect.”

Oh man, how many designers out there struggle with this? *raises hand* I’ve gone through personal site redesign after redesign after redesign. Never satisfied with my non-perfect online representation, I sat dormant, rotting in my own dissatisfaction. It was only when I made the decision to use the default Ghost theme as **my website** that I finally shed the emperor’s clothing of perfection and began to move forward. Over time I customized, tweaked, and fiddled with the design bit by bit. It’s still nowhere near perfect now and I’ve resisted the urge to do a full redesign every month for the last year. I will redesign eventually, but that time has not yet come.

>The Essentialist designs a routine that makes achieving what you have identified as essential the default position.

The book refers to routines a lot. It tells the story of Michael Phelps, US Olympic Gold Medalist and all-round super swimmer, and how he has a rigid routine that starts the very moment he gets out of bed. What he eats, what he listens to, what exercises he does, in what order. Which foot gets placed onto the platform first. By the time the competition is about to begin, he’s already won over and over and over all day long, just as he (and his coach) have planned. Swimming in the competition is just one more simple step in his routine that is already on the fast track to success. 

If we too are intentional about the essential things in our life, we can prioritize our own life instead of having someone else prioritize it for us.

>We can all purge our lives of the nonessential and embrace the way of the Essentialist–in our own ways, and in our own time, and on our own scale. We can all live a life not just of simplicity, but of high contribution and meaning.

Yep, what he said.

If this sparks any interest, I’d highly recommend giving it a read.

# Open Letter to Recruiters

>Hey!!!!!

>I was just thinking about all those emails you've been sending me and I just realized I have a great opportunity for you!!!!! I'm writing a blog post that you are absolutely going to love! Your eyeballs will literally pop out of you head after skimming the first paragraph. I'm not talking about the new figurative definition of literally, I'm talking **literally** eyeballs dangling from their gooey sockets by those weird eyeball strings that remain connected to your skull. Either way it will be one of the most intense experiences of your life!!!!!!

>If you are looking for an opportunity to be a part of a cutting edge reader base with the ability to conceptualize, brainstorm, prototype, sell things, microwave things, easy-bake things, mix things, stir things, create synergy, engage with brands, ie. create the "the next big thing" in the interaction consumer space, absolutely without a doubt, contact me immediately!!!

>This is going to be sooooooooooo awesome!!!!

>With the sincerest of sincere yet cozy warm regards,

>Matt D. Smith

Firstly, I want to point out that this post is not a public shaming of the profession of recruiting. I believe it is indeed a valuable profession - a difficult and challenging one at that.

In fact, I attribute much of my early success as an independent professional to the beckoning of an agency recruiter, who did a fantastic job of contacting me, relating to me on a human level, and helping me ease into the first contract project within the company.

I also had a good experience last year with a very large company, who was semi-recruiting me as I very briefly considered a full-time position with them. In the end things fizzled for the best, but I still have the utmost respect for their process.

My beef is with recruiters who blast out the same vomit-inducing pitch, not too unlike the one I started this post off with, and expect a genuine response. I'm sure this works for some organizations, but not one that I would want to work for. I'm also incredibly biased since I consider myself un-hirable for the foreseeable future as I maintain my role of independent business ownership.

## People, Not Robots
Recruiters, remember that you are contacting a person and not a robot. If you have an opportunity, genuinely seek out a qualified candidate not just any warm body with a working set of keyboard and mouse hands. 

Think of your job as a date with the intention of marriage. You are meeting someone for the first time in hopes that they will marry you, but you don't say that on the first date! What if they are psycho?

Even if they were a good fit, going on a cathartic monologue on your very first date with someone, pretty much ruins any further progression in your relationship. Instead, get to know your prospect a little bit before the *big ask*. Don't ask someone to marry you in your first email.

## Email Script That You Should Use
Here's a little email script that you are free to use. Try this one out and see if your response rates are better. 

>Hey [First Name],

>[Personal link bonus. Someone you both mutually know, same college, previous job, etc. This is not required, but definitely helpful.]

>I've checked out lots of your work on [your portfolio, Dribbble, etc.] and I'm really impressed. I especially love [this project] and [these details].

>I'm looking for a [this position type] to work with [my company] on a [contract or full-time basis]. If you're interested to hear more, I'd love to chat.

>Thanks [First Name],

>[Recruiter first name]


## The Breakdown

>Hey [First Name]

You got my name right! This is sort of important, but easily screwed up if you're blasting out the same crappy email left and right. You'll also notice that "Matt" is not "Matthew," Dan is not "Daniel," "Josh" is not "Joshua," etc. Don't mess this up. 

>[Personal link bonus. Someone you both mutually know, same college, previous job, etc. This is not required, but definitely helpful.]

This builds credibility from the start. If you can link yourself to me in some way that isn't creepy, then do it.

>I've checked out lots of your work on [your portfolio, Dribbble, etc.] and I'm really impressed. I especially love [this project] and [these details].

This lets me know instantly that you've looked at my work and you like it. I like that you like it. It makes me feel good. The fact that you go so far as to name a specific project and details about the specific project, lets me know that you've done your homework on me and aren't just sending out a canned response, which I will instantly delete if I get a whiff of that.

>I'm looking for a [this position type] to work with [my company] on a [contract or full-time basis]. 

This sentence lets me know exactly what you're emailing me about, which company it's for, and whether it's contract or full-time work. 99.9% of the time, I never entertain full-time asks. I will however entertain contract work under certain circumstances. I don't need to hear any buzz words like "cutting-edge" or "next big thing." That will just make me think that you are sloppy in your approach to get my attention and will put you one step closer to my trashcan.

>If you're interested to hear more, I'd love to chat.

Very simple. If I'm interested, I'll let you know. Otherwise, your email was fairly short and concise - easy for me to digest. I am likely to send a reply even if I'm not interested. After all, you took the time to look at my work, compliment me on it, and tell me specific things you like about a specific project. Since you stroked my ego a bit, out of respect, I will likely politely decline your offer even if it is of no interest to me.

>Thanks [First Name],

>[Recruiter first name]

Hey, you remembered my name. If you got it right twice that let's me know that you may have actually thoughtfully written to me. Oh look, you put your first name too. It's like we just met and introduced ourselves in a very informal fashion.

I guarantee that if you stick to the above format, you'll have more quality responses than you'll know what to do with. But remember, I'm probably not interested.

# How to Create a Big Blurry Image with Photoshop, Illustrator, or  Sketch

![sketch photoshop illustrator blurry](/content/images/2014/Sep/photoshop_illustrator_sketch_blurry-1.jpg)

Blurry images are like Hansel, so [hot right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV_hDyfmEw4&noredirect=1). There's a few different ways to create them, so we'll look at this technique in Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch.

First and foremost, the software you use depends primarily on what you're comfortable creating in, as well as the specific reason your trying to blur an image in the first place.

## Blurry Images in Photoshop

If you only need a giant blurry image for a background or something similar, then the software doesn't matter very much, but if you need to manipulate the image itself beyond simple blurring, like creating composite images, etc., you'll be best off in Photoshop for your blurry business. Hence the name, *Photo*shop.

![photoshop canvas](/content/images/2014/Sep/photoshop1.png)

Once the image is opened inside of photoshop, it's always a good idea to create a copy of the layer before doing any type of editing, in case we need the original layer for anything later. Right click the layer and select `Duplicate Layer` or better yet hit `Command + J`.

![photoshop duplicate layer](/content/images/2014/Sep/photoshop2.png)

Next, we'll convert it to a smart object. Right click the layer and choose `Convert to a Smart Object`.

![photoshop smart object](/content/images/2014/Sep/photoshop7.png)

We can still apply a gaussian blur to a dumb object, but once we do, we can't remove the effect without trashing it and starting over. It's always a best practice to use non-destructive editing techniques when possible, leaving opportunity for adjustments if things change as the design progresses.

With the smart object selected, choose `Gaussian Blur` from `Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur`

![photoshop gaussian blur](/content/images/2014/Sep/photoshop3.png)

The blur radius amount is really a personal preference depending on your particular taste and use case. For this example, let's go with 50.

![photoshop gaussian blur panel 50](/content/images/2014/Sep/photoshop8.png)

Ahhh, yeah. Nice and blurry.

![photoshop blurry](/content/images/2014/Sep/photoshopblurry.png)

And because we used a smart object instead of a raw rasterized image, we can double click the `smart filter` to activate the blur dialog again and change it.

![photoshop gaussian blur panel 20](/content/images/2014/Sep/photoshop9.png)

That's how you blur images in Photoshop.

## Blurry Images in Illustrator

![illustrator opened](/content/images/2014/Sep/illustrator1.png)

Blurring photos in Illustrator is pretty similar to Photoshop. With the image opened or placed inside of Illustrator, select the image on the canvas and choose `Effect > Blur > Gaussian Blur`.

![illustrator blur](/content/images/2014/Sep/illustrator2.png)

This gives us a similar dialog for adjusting the blur radius. Set it to 50 and that's it!

![illustrator 50](/content/images/2014/Sep/illustrator4.png)

Unlike photoshop, these objects are pretty smart by default, in fact, you can't destroy any pixels at all in Illustrator since everything's all vectory-smooth and such.

If you'd like to go back and adjust the blur radius, make sure the `Appearance` panel is showing (`Window > Appearance`), and double click, `Gaussian Blur`. This will give you the ability to make adjustments.

![illustrator appearance](/content/images/2014/Sep/illustrator5.png)

That's it, you're now a pro-photo blurrer by way of Illustrator.

## Blurry Images in Sketch

Sketch makes it pretty easy to add a Gaussian Blur. Once the image is on the canvas, select it.

![sketch](/content/images/2014/Sep/sketch1.png)

See that checkbox over there on the right that says `Gaussian Blur`? Check it and add your blur amount. Boom, done.

![sketch checkbox](/content/images/2014/Sep/sketch2.png)

Another way to blur an image in Sketch, is by applying a background blur to an object in the foreground. Background Blur is the jam. It works great for photos, but also works with anything beneath the object as well, text, vector objects, you name it.

Hit `R` to select the rectangle tool and draw a shape on top of the image.

![rectangle](/content/images/2014/Sep/sketch_shape.png)

With the shape selected, look on the right and click on the `Gaussian Blur` text label. This will open a select box where you can choose `Background Blur`. Change the `Fill` to 20% or so to see it take effect. 

![rectangle with blur added](/content/images/2014/Sep/sketch5.png)

## Recap

There you have it - several different ways to blur an image using a number of different tools. Each method has its own pros and cons, depending on the context. Choose what's best for you and go for it.

![mds office](/content/images/2014/Mar/4.jpg)

I'm writing this post from my office. It's not just any office, it's the first official office I've had outside of my home. To date I've been here a little over two years. It's not incredibly fancy but I've loved every minute of working from this space. It's become my safe haven to get my head down and power through insane amounts of work. It's very quiet here and a sharp contrast to my previous home office, where my beautiful wife raises our three (soon to be 4) outrageously cute, wonderful and, let's face it, loud kids.

The bittersweetness I'm feeling is due to the fact that [Cowork Athens](http://twitter.com/coworkathens), aka *Quad Cowork* (more on that later), has become a reality, but I'm also sad to leave my little office. I'm incredibly excited about the progress that has been made to make a proper coworking space come to fruition, but at the same time I already miss my office. I have half of my stuff moved to the coworking space and half still in my office. I'm sort of clinging to working from here in this quaint little work sanctuary. [Take a look around the place](http://mds.sh/studio/).

While these doubts taint my mind with second thoughts, I think back to the reasons I wanted to be a part of a coworking space in the first place. A few years ago I first visited [Cowork Greenville](http://coworkgreenville.com), a vibrant coworking space that gave off an incredible vibe. The community, the people, the passion, all the things that can not be achieved being in an office by yourself all day every day.

I realized very quickly that a solid work community was a significant chunk missing from my otherwise cozy and very blessed life.

When I project my future for the next few years, I want to be a part of a greater whole, not just in a box that I enjoy by myself. I want to see greater community, greater projects, people growing and being inspired. I want to look back and see that I helped influence a larger collective and made a positive impact on the people around me. This is simply not possible, or certainly not as easy when you're alone 8+ hours a day.

So as I deal with my personal doubts and perhaps selfish motivations of solitude, I will push forward with my heart's desire that has finally unfolded before me. I will help spearhead a new community, invest in others, and give it all I've got. The alternative is to do nothing, stagnate, and wonder what it could've been like. Screw that. 

My slight proclivity towards extraversion is delighted that coworking in Athens is about to happen, while my introverted parts are freaking out a bit. That's just the nature of the beast when it comes to big changes I suppose.

*But then I see a video like this and the motivation comes rushing right back.*

# Blogging and Your Future

![john at transform](/content/images/2014/Feb/saddington_at_transform-1.jpg)

Last night, I had [John Saddington](http://john.do/about) come and give a presentation at [Transform Athens](http://www.meetup.com/transform-athens/events/159982002/). When I first contacted John about speaking, I told him that the topic was totally up to him, but preferably something he was passionate about. Well if you've ever visited his blog or talked to him for long, you'll find out pretty quickly that blogging is a huge passion for him - he's been blogging in some form or fashion since 2001. That's a long time folks.

John's presentation was an honest and raw look at his past and his views on writing in general. He listed out the various opportunities that have presented themselves as a direct result of his blog. John formed a business partnership with one of the commenters on his blog, whom he originally thought was a troll. 

There were lots of questions from the audience about the best platform to use, how to create a strategy for blogging, should it have a business facade or be personal, should I be concerned about over sharing, etc. John fielded the questions eloquently as he kept driving the same point home.

>If you don't hit publish, none of that matters. Just publish and it'll make a world of difference. - John Saddington

Just publish. 

That was the core message. People flock to the web to search, stalk, learn, and find information about you. When you've put yourself (work, thoughts, opinions, etc.) online, people can learn about you. You exist in a virtual space in larger capacity due to the size of your online footprint.

John told a story about an interviewee at a recent company who had no online presence with the exception of a sad LinkedIn page and he thought, "Who are you? It's like you don't even exist." *Cue laughter from the audience*.

It may be sad to think about, but it's true. The very fact that you are reading this right now gives you a glimpse into my head, my thoughts. It's like we're sitting down for coffee right now and I'm telling you about what I did last night. Only instead of having a one on one conversation I'm logging my thoughts onto my blog. What happens from here is up to the crazy wormhole that is the internet.

Just yesterday someone in Scotland [tweeted](https://twitter.com/yumfriedgold/status/436495811724066816) about my [*Daughters*](http://mattdsmith.com/daughters) post. I have no idea how he found it, but he did and now he knows a little more about me.

John gave some simple advice to get started blogging.

- Choose a platform that you will actually use. 
- Write about your experience.
- Tell your story.
- Spend a minimum of 15 minutes per week and you'll have a blog.
- Schedule some time to write.
- Just publish.
- Don't worry about the design of your blog. People will get tired of it after 10 visits anyways.

John's current site is using the default Wordpress theme and he has tens of thousands of visitors everyday. The design matters far far less than the actual content. As a matter of fact, at the time of this writing, I'm using the default Ghost theme for this blog.

He summed up his talk with 3 things that his father taught him.

1. Never give up
2. Always have options
3. Never be afraid to ask for something

That's it. Go forth and blog!

# Designing an App With Onboarding in Mind - A Breakdown of the Rivalry! Redesign

I recently completed a full UX and UI redesign for [Rivalry](#), an app the lets you send your team’s callout to friends. 

![]()

Last fall [Daniel McBrayer](http://twitter.com/dmcbrayer), a fellow Athenian, reached out to me about some UX/UI work. He told me he and a few other people were working on a simple app called Rivalry!, which is essentially [Yo](http://www.justyo.co) for sportsball. Football to be exact.

It’s not that often that I have time to pick up a quick project like that, but since they were local, it seemed simple enough, and I was right in between the end of one big project and the beginning of another. So I went for it.

Nothing in the initial UI was set in stone and the team was open to any and all suggestions for improvement. With such simple functionality and constraints it was a really fun playground to explore and discover new ways of doing things. This is one of the biggest attractions I had to working on the project.

## Pre-Redesign App Screens
After chatting with Daniel about the project, I downloaded the app and started poking around.

![rivalry app pre-redesign](/content/images/2015/02/rivalry-02.gif)

After digging through, I made some quick notes about the app for our upcoming kickoff meeting.

**Notes**

- push notifications (why are you asking me up front?)
- sign in wall (need more context, why should I sign up?)
- form fields need labels (lots of placeholder fields with no labels)
- why do you need my phone number? 
- consider alternative method of selecting school (the default iOS selector is pretty difficult to manage with so many options)
- errors with no explanation (on sign up)
- click instead of tap to add friends (copywriting changes)
- help me do less work (a concept that should be thought through and implemented)
- feed of suggested people to follow (username with college supported? to help prime the first time UX)

---

We met and walked through the app together and my notes. I presented an idea for a new onboarding experience, pushing the “Sign up” section much further down the user path.

Signing up was still a priority, but leading with an authentication wall causes lots of people to drop out before they have a chance to know what the app is all about– kind of like asking someone to marry you on your first date. It’s not impossible, but the odds are better if you get to know the person a little first. Hangout, watch a movie together, develop a relationship. You’ve got to do the same with an app if you want to win people over.

Here was the new flow concept written out. Keep in mind, I hadn’t done any designing yet. It's crucial to have a deep understanding of the goals and objectives before creating designs.

**New Flow**

1. Download the app
2. Launch the app
3. Pick your team
4. Harass a rivalry a few times
5. Get harassed back (now we have an idea of what’s going on)
6. Add friends (sign up)
7. Harass friends
8. Get Harassed back
9. Repeat 6-8
10. Collect information only where vital

---

After this meeting, I wrote out the deliverables to be provided so everyone knew what to expect from me.

**Deliverables**
- Refine the design of the 5 existing screens (fix blurry icons explore other color options and/or text treatments for label input fields, team selector, buttons, and callout treatments)
- Write messaging and create designs for the current app “dead ends” (e.g. What to do before you sign up or sign in (on boarding), what to do if you don’t know any friends in the app)
- Explore some Rivalry! app icon treatments
- Up to 2 rounds of revisions

The 5 sections I envisioned that needed to be redesigned were Sign up, Log in, Settings, Main friend list, and Add friends. 

![simple flow](/content/images/2015/02/screens.png)

After everyone was on the same page about our plan and what I would do, I started designing wireframes. What I originally planned for was 5 or so screens, but when everything was all said and done, I ended up with over 20 screens wireframed.

A lot of these *are* the same screen with different interactive states, but regardless it’s fair to say that this is much more complex that “designing 5 screens.” It’s always important to remember yourself why a term like “screen” is so abstract that it’s not a good measuring stick by itself to determine the level of design effort required. The wireframes below are a testament to that.

![wireframe bird’s eye view](/content/images/2015/02/birdseye.png)

[View the full size PDF](/content/images/2015/02/rivalry-flow-mds-v0.4.pdf)

## Redesigning the UX
The biggest structural change was the onboarding experience– getting the people interacting with the app before being asked to sign up, even though the premise of the app is to heckle friends, there had to be a way to show value before asking for information.

To make this possible, we moved the “Pick Your Team” section out of the Sign Up flow and put it front and center, revealing itself as soon as the app is launched.

![pick your team ux](/content/images/2015/02/pickteam.png)

<div style="background: url(/content/images/2015/02/rivalry-3-wide-1.png) center no-repeat fixed #222;" class="fullwidth"></div>

<!-- <div style="background: #222; padding: 4em 0" class="fullwidth">
<img src="/content/images/2015/02/pick-team.png" alt="pick your team ui"/>
</div> -->

By doing this, we’re accomplishing two things: First, we’re allowing people to interact with the app without requiring too much info. The level of effort required to choose a team is extremely low, plus the curiosity of what will happen next is still fresh since this is the very first time someone is using the app.

Secondly, were providing people a sense of ownership over the app. By having the team picked first, the colors of the title bar and global UI elements change to be your team’s primary and secondary color. With a simple tap, we can give immediate value. So if a University of Georgia fan does indeed choose *UGA*. The app changes to red and black and the following screen’s title is *GO DAWGS!*. There’s nothing more representative of a spirited sports team than the colors that represent them.

Next, we needed people to interact with the app to give it a test drive. The solution was to pull in some Rivalbots. After you choose a team, we switch you to your team colors, and present 3 rivals for your team. So if you pick UGA, you get Florida Gators, Georgia Tech, and Auburn Tigers. The same goes for any other selected team and their rivals.

![send callout](/content/images/2015/02/sendcallout.png)

With a small bit of helper text, we can coax people into tapping one of the Rivalbots to send their own team’s callout. What die hard Georgia fan wouldn’t want to say “Go Dawgs!” to a Georgia Tech fan?

## Exquisitely Timed Permission Requests
Push notifications are a huge deal with this app. Receiving a heckle from a friend results in a push notification with their team’s callout playing on your phone. Here are a few samples below.

<audio title="go dawgs" preload="auto" controls>
<source src="/assets/audio/GoDawgs.m4a">
</audio>
<audio title="go cocks" preload="auto" controls>
<source src="/assets/audio/GoCocks.m4a">
</audio>
<audio title="roll tide" preload="auto" controls>
<source src="/assets/audio/RollTide.m4a">
</audio>


This **is** the experience so we needed to be extremely careful about when we ask for push notification request. The ask needed to be very contextual and very enticing. Instead of request push notifications up front, we opted to create a sense of Rivalry up front with the Rivalbots. Once you tap a Rivalbot to send your teams callout, the app programmatically sends one back to you, to simulate the would be experience with friends.

![rivalbots](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

Only after tapping your first Rivalbot do we present the option for push notifications. We’re only allowed to ask one time within iOS, otherwise you have to go to settings to turn them on. With this in mind we present a pre-request request to prime you for the upcoming question.

![bring it on](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

If they use *Not now*, no harm, no foul. We can ask them that same question again later after they’ve sent another handful of callouts. If they do tap *Bring it on*, we finally give them the *real* permission request. The precious, one-time permission request that will make or break the experience for them.

![push notification request](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

Then *and only then* do we give people the option to Sign Up. Now they have two choices, keep sending callouts to the Rivalbots, or Sign Up and start heckling real people. Not a very complex system in a relative sense, but dramatically different than asking someone to *sign up* from the very beginning.

![sign up option](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

## Sign Up
Once someone has chosen to *sign up* instead of being forced to, we can assume that they have arrived to the page at their own will. Even still, this doesn’t mean we can now squeeze out and ask for any information we want. We still need to be respectful, asking only of what’s required for them to proceed.

Email and password is required for logging into the system, as is username which is the one personal identifier throughout the app. These three fields are vital. Without them, there is no further experience, therefore we *must* require them.

There is an optional phone number field that helps others find you based on whether they have your contact info or not. Even though this is optional it’s crucial that we tell the would-be user why we’re asking for this information. If you don’t tell someone why you asking for their information it’s safe to say that they’ll assume the worse about your intentions. So here we give them a little more context about why we would ask for their *optional* phone number with a small bit of helper text, which reads “Your phone number lets contacts find you more easily.” 

And no placeholder-only input field would be complete with some good’ol contextual [float labels](/float-label-pattern).

![sign up input](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

## Recruiting
Once your signed in, we remove the *Sign up* and *Log In* buttons and introduce a *Settings* icon in the top right to control your basic info, place your username as the screen’s title, and add a big *Recruit* button in the center.

As you move through a few preliminary screens, you effectively change the design of the app with one tap to your team’s colors, you get to send your own callout to a Rival, and now your own username is the title of the screen. The idea is to make you feel like you have complete control and ownership. And you do!

![authenticated](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

The *Recruit* button was originally designed as a `+` icon in the top right, but after deliberating the best option, it seemed very appropriate to stick with the sports theme and play off of that terminology for this particular action. It can often be detrimental to mix well established digital metaphors such as *invite, favorites, cart, log in, sign up, etc.* with brand specific ones, but in this case it felt right for *Recruit* to replace a `+` icon or the word *Invite*.

![recruit](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

Tapping *Recruit* allows you to find friends already using Rivalry, who’ve opted to enter their phone number when signing up. Alternatively, you can search for a specific user, search your contacts, and invite friends via Twitter and Facebook.

![recruit screen](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

![recruit options](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

## Redesigning the UI
Since the premise of the app is based off of the Yo model– simple tiles that perform a single action only the interface needed to remain very simplistic. The only catch was that it needed to accommodate a wide variety of color combinations. Every team has two colors. A team’s primary color is their biggest signifier and even more so when combined with the secondary color. 

One of the biggest visual challenges was figuring out how to design the non team-related screens with neutral colors. The existing app used white and green as a neutral approach, but this still felt wrong to me and didn’t feel completely team neutral, but I did like the neutral interface idea.

I initially explored design options like team-colored, slab-serif text with a white background instead of the vivid and bright backgrounds in the existing designs. The thought had merit, but most of these designs ended up looking like crap. A very Skittles-like palette, which just didn’t convey the feeling we were going for. We needed an entertainment, football, Sports Center, ESPN highlights kind of thing. Plus the slab-serifs felt too old-school collegiate-like instead of new and fresh and bold.

![rivalry skittles](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

After tasting the rainbow by mistake, I spit out the proverbial Skittles and went for a darker, more sophisticated feel. I went a little too far and starting losing the blocky simple nature of the app with the small text, etc. It started feeling too technical. I was still struggling to figure out the whole neutral UI thing.

![darker rivalry](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

I reexamined the existing app and realized that the bold primary and secondary colors on the tiles really gave them character and most accurately displayed the team in all its colorful glory. I scrapped the thin lines and went for big bold type with as few UI variations as possible. 

This is when things really started to click. The solution seems so simple, but took a fair amount of exploration to get there. Once I settled on using the bold primary and secondary colors, it was apparent that I needed some bold text to compliment the tiles.

These constraints opened up more possibilities. With the new bold tiles, I could worry less about a neutral UI and use the team colors to my advantage. Since we’re having people choose the team first, the team tiles and colors *are* the UI. With this revelation, I started exploring the possibility of having the title bar become the primary team color and the actions colored with the team’s secondary color.

![rivalry colors](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

## Harnessing the Power of Sketch
This was the aha moment. I designed a simple white header with a blue *Log In” link for the very first screen, but once a team was chosen the UI became that team’s colors. So simple, but it really felt right. We could use a team’s primary color as the title bar background and the secondary color as the text on top. I needed one more variation to subtly differentiate secondary actions, etc. so I created a color that was simply 50% opacity of the team’s secondary value.

I wanted to test this design theory across multiple team colors, but didn’t want to change every single instance of a primary and secondary color. Enter Sketch symbols and styles. I created a quick artboard of the common elements– title bar background, the subtle gradient background for the team tile, the callout text, title bar text, button backgrounds, and 50% secondary color items. Each one was defined as a style and applied to every screen in the UI.

![rivalry styles](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

![sketch styles panel](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

With this setup, I got the the JSON file that contained all of the team’s primary and secondary colors to use as reference for testing multiple teams. This was incredibly efficient.

![rivarly color change](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

Here are some instances of teams that were quickly tested using this technique.

![uga](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

![baylor](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

![army](/content/images/2015/02/placeholder.png)

## The Final Product
The final product has a really fun personal touch to it. Now that your team selection determines the entire look and feel of the app, it feels like we’ve effectively leveraged minimal input for maximum output. It’s a simple concept, but it’s got me  really interested to explore this input::output ration further in [future projects](/working).

# Brooklyn Beta 2013

![Brooklyn Beta](http://distilleryimage8.ak.instagram.com/13e2dc4e3b2d11e3b7f822000a1fb726_8.jpg)

Anytime I visit New York, I'm both thrilled and overwhelmed. My most recent visit was for Brooklyn Beta.

As I stepped out of my Uber black car at my alleged Airbnb address and pretended to know what I was doing by authoritatively whipping out my phone. Little did passer-bys know I was frantically texting my bunk-mate, [Brandon](http://twitter.com/brandonhoulihan). In an instant, he magically popped out of the apartment door in front of me, crushing my geological doubts.

I dropped of my suitcase, got acclimated to the 2 bed 1 bath apartment, and was off.

On the [website](https://brooklynbeta.org/2013/details), Chris and Cameron use the term [_MacGuffin_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin) to describe Brooklyn Beta. It's essentially an excuse to do something else - to move the plot along.

I must say it was a pretty damn good one. Nathan Peretic wrote a [good post](http://www.nathanperetic.com/2013/10/17/whats-it-like-to-go-to-brooklyn-beta) about some of the event flaws, but goes on to say: 

>...the conference is what **you** make it. Conferences are what **you** make them. Day-to-day existence is what **you** make it. Complain, if you want, about the unfairness, exalt in the thrill of the chase, sit back and take it all in. It’s up to you.

I whole-heartedly agree. In fact, if you only go to conferences (or anywhere for that matter) to be served an experience on a platter, chances are you'll be disappointed.

There were indeed parts that were good and bad, but ultimately you will find what you're looking for, be it flaw or beauty.

The MacGuffin served it's purpose for me. It was enough of a reason to leave my precious wife and kids, whom I love dearly, for nearly a whole week. Enough of a reason to spend a hefty wad of cash on plane tickets, accomodations, etc. Enough of a reason to postpone paying client work.

Brooklyn Beta was hanging out with friends and meeting new ones, shrowded in a conference. I made the most of it and enjoyed every last drip drop.

Huge thanks to all of you guys and gals, whom I had the pleasure to meet and speak with. You made it worth it.

Also, I [sang karaoke](http://instagram.com/p/fWPmNDkFO3/) at the Navy Yard. _Thanks for the video, [Ish](http://twitter.com/burciaga)!_

# Building a Web App and an Online Course While Managing Client Work

![aiux designs](/content/images/2015/08/aiux-module-page.png)

I’m currently doing all three of these things and it’s not easy. If you’re unaware, my original launch date for the [AIUX](/aiux) Course was August 1, 2015. I managed to finish 99% of the course videos by that date, but along the way I decided to build my own web app to go with it. Needless to say this made things a little more complicated.

Over two weeks have come and gone with no launch, but I’ve made incredible progress nonetheless. The app is built and functioning well and will serve as a great platform to publish this first course as well as potential future courses. 

You may be thinking, 
>“It would have been easier to put together a Wordpress build with some modified plugins etc.”

and yes, you’re probably right, but a [friend of mine](http://brownwebdesign.com), who also happens to be a great Ruby developer, was willing to take on some risk with a small amount of cash upfront and help me build a small Ruby app, so that’s what we’ve done. I feel really good about this as a future investment too, which is another big factor for me.

The [designs for the app](https://dribbble.com/mds/projects/242363-AIUX) are pretty much finished at this point minus a *Log In* screen and a few other odds and ends. I believe I would’ve been able to finish everything by now, but over the last few weeks I needed to pick up a client project to keep the cash flowing.

## Bootstrapped
I’ve bootstrapped every little project I’ve ever had and couldn’t imagine doing it any other way. The number one thing I value with my work is freedom. Sometimes it’s more of a perceived freedom, but it’s all very cut and dry. Don’t have the money? Take on more client work to get more money. Store up cash to buy more time.

Because I’m funding everything myself, so that means money is finite. I’ve got a family of [four](/four) to provide for and cashflow is a *very* important piece of bootstrapping puzzle. Perhaps the most important.

I took two months off from client work during June and July to work on AIUX, but didn’t quite get it all finished. When I started running low on cash, I needed to pick up some client work and that’s what I did.

The first project I picked up is very timely as I’m utilizing the **EXACT** same techniques that I teach in the AIUX Responsive Web Design course that’s in the works. For this particular project I negotiated a fixed rate of $15,000 and a fixed timeline of 3 weeks—in which I only need to dedicate 7-8 full days of solid work. 

I wouldn’t normally just randomly throw out numbers like this, but I want to start showing how beneficial this type of UX design work can be, especially when you sell the value of your work, rather than only hours. More on that later.

## What's Next
I plan to code up the front-end for the [new designs](https://dribbble.com/mds/projects/242363-AIUX) and start integrating the course videos and lesson plans over the next few weeks. So now I’m setting another faux launch date of September 1st.

~~If you want to hear more about how you can use your UX design skills to drum up 5-figure projects like the one I’m finishing now, hop on the AIUX list. I’ll be sharing lots of personal stories and techniques for how I land projects like that and the techniques I use to knock out the work.~~

The private beta was a smashing success. <br/>

# Relationships are the Secret Sauce for Success

My wife and I recently celebrated 10 years of marriage. The past decade seems like a short breath, but in actuality it’s been a marathon. You don’t get to 10 years of marriage without dealing with relationship issues. We dated for 4 years before we got married too, so we had already had plenty of conflict resolution under our belts.

<figure>
<img src="/content/images/2015/10/honeymooners-1.jpg" alt="young matt and shana" />
<figcaption>Young Matt and Shana on their honeymoon 
10 years ago at the ripe age of 22. Much to learn, they have.</figcaption>
</figure>

Just like marriage, **relationships are the key to succeeding in most real world situations too**. Whether you’re in college getting your degree, designing a product for a hot new startup, or waiting tables at a local restaurant, if you can succeed in creating and maintaining healthy relationships you’ll have infinite more power than someone who can’t.

## The Designer/Developer Relationship
In our industry, this is one of the more unique relationships. In most cases, and I’m generalizing, the designer designs the thing and the developer makes the thing work. Not necessarily in that order, but those are the ingredients—**design and build**.

If we think of this two-part combo as a mere transaction, then the transaction has no lasting value, and as soon as things go haywire, the claws come out. Designers get pissed that implemented designs look nothing like their pristine layout and developers get pissed that the designer had no regard for components or reusable code, or the general flow of HTML across a page.

In this case, there is no relationship and there is no ability to share and understand the feelings of the other person—Empathy, the term our industry so loves to use.

It’s possible to manufacture empathy towards someone you don’t have a relationship with, but it’s far easier to empathize with someone you’ve personally invested in by getting to know them and starting a relationship.

>The most successful projects I’ve ever been a part of were when I worked hand-in-hand with the developer throughout the entire process.

If a designer takes a moment to share his designs with the developer and ask questions about the implementation or feasibility of certain features and *really* listened, then he would gain an understanding of the technical point of view and reasons for any technical concerns.

Likewise if a developer seeks to understand a designers intent behind certain UI or UX decisions, instead of instantly dismissing an idea, she can learn more about why decisions are being made in a certain way.

## Hand-off vs. Hand-holding
There is a time for handing-off design files to a developer, but  this shouldn’t happen until a relationship exists and there is mutual understanding and input from both parties.

For new teams working together, there may be early hand-holding. Not in a juvenile, supervisions sort of way, but a *“we don’t know how each other thinks or works and we should have lots of face time until we figure each other out”* sort of way. The more a designer and developer work with each other, the more they learn about the other’s craft, their personality, and how they react to certain social prompts.

UX flows, wireframes, designing a user interface, implementing front-end responsive code, building a back-end and breathing life into a static system— these things all require very different tracks of thought and can easily become fuddled if the relationships between areas are unhealthy.

Each one of these task are difficult in their own way. The more code I write the more I appreciate how difficult it is. It also helps me appreciate the importance of static design and how beneficial it is to move objects around until things *feel* right from a visual perspective. If all of these things are merged together without the guiding light of UX, it may all be for nothing. The product may fail because it had no real purpose. The UI may look nice. It may display properly in the browser, but it may not be useful. The UX may not have been thought out.

## BFFs
The bottom line is this—build meaningful relationships. Be curious, rather than dismissive.

Designers, get to know your developers and vice versa. The more you know about what they are doing and why, the better you can *hear* their concerns instead of just *listening* to them. The more you can empathize with each other and work as a team.

Who knows, if you pull this off really well, you may even build a product like my wife and I have that lasts for 10+ years.

# Audio Equipment

I've got plans to create [something new](/doing-a-new-thing) and decided to do it right with some proper equipment. After using Twitter to get quick feedback on a podcast mic, I got several different suggestions.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Best starter podcast/videocast mics that I can talk my wife into letting me purchase? &#10;&#10;cc <a href="https://twitter.com/avclark">@avclark</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/danielmall">@danielmall</a></p>&mdash; Matt D. Smith (@mds) <a href="https://twitter.com/mds/statuses/465926072455155713">May 12, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

[View replies](https://twitter.com/mds/statuses/465926072455155713)

My friend, [Adam](http://twitter.com/avclark), who just so happens to be the host of [The Gently Mad](http://thegentlymad.com), told me I should definitely go with the [Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB/XLR](http://mds.io/VjXw) for a solid starter mic under $100. I was really intrigued initially by the [Blue Yeti](http://mds.io/VjJI), but after more research I concluded that I wanted a flexible mic stand that wasn't standing right in front of me. This will give me more room while I create video screencasts and such. The Blue Yeti looks cool, but also pretty big and clunky sitting right there on the middle of your desk.

Here's [a full list](http://mds.io/Vjsx) of the audio equipment I bought from Amazon:

![audiotechnica mic](/content/images/2014/May/mic.jpg)

**[Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB/XLR Microphone](http://mds.io/VjXw)**
I did a fair amount of research, listened to [some tests](http://rayortega.com/gear/) and decided that with the price plus the recommendation, that this would be a good way to start. I *almost* decided to go more expensive with the [Audio-Technica AT2020](http://mds.io/Vj9a), but figured I could upgrade later if this turns out to be something I do consistently.


![rode boom arm](/content/images/2014/May/boom_arm.jpg)

**[RODE PSA 1 Swivel Mount Studio Microphone Boom](http://mds.io/VjqN)**
This was also recommended by Adam and I've seen a few other podcasters using a similar setup. I don't like things cluttering up my desk, so I was sold on this immediately.


![mic pop filter](/content/images/2014/May/pop_filter.jpg)

**[Nady MPF-6 6-Inch Clamp on Microphone Pop Filter](http://mds.io/VjVu)**
I'm not sure if I'll actually need this or not, but the price isn't bad so I figured I'd give it a try and pile it into the cart while all of this stuff is being shipped anyways.


![mic windscreen](/content/images/2014/May/foam_ball.jpg)

**[On Stage Foam Ball-Type Mic Windscreen](http://mds.io/VjlH)**
This is the smaller alternative to the above pop filter. It was only $3 so I went ahead and picked it up too.


![mic shock mount](/content/images/2014/Jun/61wd_yjCBxL__SL1500_.jpg)

**[Audio-Technica AT-8415 Low-Profile Universal Shock Mount with Flexible Band](http://mds.io/Vuho)**
After researching shock mounts, I came across a few different places where the author mentioned moving the mic and repositioning it during recordings without hearing a noticeable sound. I like the idea that I can move the mic around during a recording (within reason) and not get mic bump noise.

Here are all of the items in a public [Amazon Wish List](http://mds.io/Vjsx) if you fancy these items as well.

# What Caddying Taught Me About UX

Forecaddying to be exact. A forecaddie doesn’t carry a bag of clubs, but rather stays ahead of a cart-riding, foursome of golfers. His duties consist of finding golf balls, taking pin-distance measurements, cleaning clubs, fetching clubs, bagging clubs, holding clubs, reading putts, and more.

This was my job during the latter half of my college years. It is to date, the most arduous hiring process I’ve ever had to go through. There was a 3 part interview - general golf questions, a 30 minute phone interview where the caller would asked questions like, “Have you ever felt the flow?” and “Can you describe an example where you’ve gone above and beyond?” and an on-site group interview at The Ritz-Carlton, Reynolds Plantation Luxury Golf Resort.

If you were fortunate enough to pass the phone/social/psychological interview portion, you were brought in for a 5 day, unpaid training session. You were taught the basics of forecaddying and eventually graduated as a certified professional forecaddie.

---

Forecaddying is all about staying attentive to your golfers’ needs. Each member at the course is treated like a VIP, so the pressure is on big time not to screw up.

You typically meet them on the driving range and begin asking questions like “Where are you from?,” “What brings you out here?,” “How often do you golf?,” “What’s your handicap?,” “Would you like me to clean your clubs?,” etc. We call this user research in the design world, but it’s really just asking questions, sincerely listening and paying attention because you actually care.

In addition to getting to know the golfers, you have to be able to read them. Their body language, the way they interact with people. Do they seem easy going or are they cussing on the driving range after slicing the ball 100 yards to the right? You have to determine very quickly what type of personality type they are and what type of service they are going to prefer. You find this out more and more with each hole played, but to start with, you’ve got to use your gut. You have to read them and adapt.

Some golfers want to know every detail about the hole they are about to play while on the tee box. Others like to figure it out for themselves with only a minimal amount of information. Some golfers like to have their club-face cleaned after every shot and carried back to their bag. Others like to carry it themselves. Most golfers like to know if there are any breaks on the green that aren’t apparent. You have to remember and act on all of this while running through the woods looking for golf balls, stepping off measurements from the nearest yardage-marked sprinkler head, tallying and writing down distances for every player, and running around like a madman albeit composed and confident.

Generally there will be one high maintenance golfer, two easy going ones, and one quiet self-sufficient type. You have to adjust your service to fit each one at every aspect during the game. Which one will rake their own bunker? Which one wants you to read their putt, mark their ball, etc.? You strive to make each person happy with your performance because after all, you are working towards that big tip at the end.

There are so many variables to process it seems daunting but this is where the “flow” comes in, as the phone interviewer alluded to, so many weeks before.

This is no different than our job as designers. We have to understand our users before we can effectively design for them. We need to know what they like, what they don’t like, how they interact, what are their preferences. We parse all of this information to make informed and intuitive decisions regarding interfaces and flows. Just like caddying a round of golf, we start with assumptions about the golfers and refine as the game continues. As we learn more about users, we modify our service for them and begin to relate on a more personal level - from copywriting to interactions and beyond.

Many times after finishing a round of golf, I often felt very much connected to the players. It wasn’t uncommon for returning golfers to request caddies they had previously used - friendships were built. We shared stories and experiences together. The golfers trust the caddies because they were extremely knowledgeable about the course and provided paramount service.

There was a sign at the caddie office that said “Caring to serve. Driven to be the best.” Although I thought it was incredibly cheesy at the time, this should be no different with all of our digital endeavors.

# Cancer

I got the news today that one of my best friend's dad just passed away. After a year of battling cancer, it ultimately spread and took over. Suddenly everything I'm doing seems trite and unimportant.

Shortly after I graduated high school, another best friend of mine lost his mom to ovarian cancer. My wife's mom has had and recovered from cervical cancer. A good friend from my church is currently battling lung cancer. He's never smoked in his life. 

My stepmother's sister is currently battling ovarian cancer. Another couple that my wife and I are good friends with, have a young son who recently went through a long and arduous bout with leukemia, which thankfully ended with a bone marrow transplant and full remission. Praise God. He's friends with my oldest son. 

My wife lost her grandfather to cancer a few years ago. Her best friend's dad died of cancer a year or two before that.

As I pause and reflect on all of this, I mean really let it sink in, my core is rattled. Death is very real. Whether it's cancer or not, death happens. 

I reflect often on the way I choose to spend my time, the projects I choose to work on, and how I live my life. Days like today amplify those thoughts. Life is not to be taken for granted.

Ben, I'm so sorry for you loss. I love you.

# Celebrating Checkpoints

In a [recent post](/the-not-so-secret-productivity-secret/) I made the public goal of completing all of the videos for my first [AIUX](/aiux) course by June 30– a goal that was not achieved. I estimated 12 videos that needed to be made for one of the major sections, but that turned out to be more like 40 videos. I did still manage to finish them all three days after my goal though, so I still consider that a win. 

Sitting in a room *by yourself* with no windows and recording videos *of yourself* teaching the design process of a project you’ve already designed is quite the mental task, but after several weeks of intense screen time, I’m thrilled that milestone is complete. 

I treated myself this week by working on some branding and art direction for AIUX as a whole. I designed a custom logotype and started building out parts of an entire font for the new look. Type design has addictive qualities so I had to cut myself off before I got in too deep. Overall I’m pretty happy with how the logotype turned out.

![aiux logotype](/content/images/2015/07/aiux-in-glyphs.png)
*screenshot from the type design in Glyphs*

And a possible variation with the course name:

![aiux rwd logotype](/content/images/2015/07/aiux-rwd.png)

I’ve wanted AIUX to have a certain type of military or futuristic feel since the beginning and I like the idea of upgrading your weaponry, skills, and tactics– in regards to software speed and UX understanding. Here are some words and adjectives I’ve had in the back of my mind when designing the logo and doing some brand exploration:

- Illustrator Orange
- Tech
- Futuristic
- Space Travel (Probably because I’ve been reading and loving “The Martian”)
- Dharma Initiative
- Military
- Advanced
- Tactical
- Weaponry

With this in mind I’ve put together a few branding boards and sprinkled in a bit of Nasa Commons imagery. I feel like I need to keep the orange color palette used for the Adobe Illustrator icon and launch image, but I’m a little torn on how true to color I should stay. I like the direction overall, but I’m sure it’ll get tweaked as I start coding up the new site and course pages.

![aiux branding exploration](/content/images/2015/07/aiux-brand-board.png)

![aiux branding exploration](/content/images/2015/07/aiux-brand-board-copy.png)

![aiux branding exploration](/content/images/2015/07/aiux-brand-board-copy-2.png)

![aiux branding exploration](/content/images/2015/07/aiux-brand-board-copy-3.png)

![aiux branding exploration](/content/images/2015/07/aiux-brand-board-copy-4.png)

![aiux branding exploration](/content/images/2015/07/aiux-brand-board-copy-5.png)

![aiux branding exploration](/content/images/2015/07/aiux-brand-board-copy-6.png)

![aiux branding exploration](/content/images/2015/07/aiux-brand-board-copy-7.png)

I'm not sure how much of the imagery I'll actually use on the site, but it helps give a feel for the direction.

The videos were by far the toughest part of this project, so I’m really really glad I knocked those out first. I’ll continue to play with some design stuff this week as well as layout the course structure.

I plan to have a few rough prototypes coded up so they can be ported over to the app code next week. My friend [Jess Brown](http://twitter.com/brownwebdesign) is helping me with a basic rails app to handle stripe payment processing, authentication, course and module creation, as well as tracking progress throughout. I’m pretty pumped how this is coming together so far.

~~I’ll be issuing the alpha course invitations soon, so If you’re interested in learning rapid UX design and helping shape this course I’d love for you to hop on the list.~~

# Consider Yourself Challenged

There's been a lot of random drama on "design twitter" as people call it.

Mainly because... 

Well let's face it, designers have a lot of opinions. And for good reason. Healthy discord is critical for making designs better. 

**Healthy**. 

That's the key word. If you care at all about the impact you have on others around you—colleagues, friends, family— **be careful with your words**. 

I can't even keep count of the number of times I've began a tweet or comment and ultimately deleted it, because it wasn't purposeful. 

Your words *(including what you type into boxes on the internet)* have the power to build up, or tear down. 

You get to choose. Construction or destruction. [Life or death](https://www.bible.com/bible/1/PRO.18.21.esv).

## Perspective
I have a challenge for you if you're having an immediate negative reaction to this article.

Take note of everything you say throughout one day. Including how you tweet. Including how you make sarcastic comments. Including the nice things you say.

Take note of *how* you say it. Your facial expressions. Your body language. How you feel.

Is it positive? Negative? Why? Why not?

I challenge you to answer those questions.

It all boils down to this...

You **will** find what you are looking for.

Whether it's **pain** or **pleasure**, **beauty** or **flaw**, **suffering** or **joy**, you will find it.

What you believe and set your mind on, will manifest for you. Whether it's toxic or refreshing.

Hopefully you've realized I'm talking about a shift in personal perspective and world view and not just commenting on designs.

Here's a quote from one of my favorite books that sums it up more eloquently.

> The soul attracts that which it secretly harbours; that which it loves, and also that which it fears; it reaches the height of its cherished aspirations; it falls to the level of its unchastened desires, and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own.

-James Allen, [As a Man Thinketh](http://thinketh.co)

I [made a website for that book](http://thinketh.co) a few years ago. It only takes about an hour to read. Highly recommended.

See you on the internet!

—Matt

# Change

>"The only thing that is constant is change"

― [Heraclitus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus)

I've never had a favorite season. Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer. None of them are my favorite. I like the in between. The transition. I like the change. The smell of fall with its cool air effortlessly flowing through each deep breath. The petite bite of winter's dawn with a hint of smoke in the air. The break from the cold air when the drops of Spring reveal themselves. The warm sun finally baking down for a refreshing dip in the pool.

It's the in between, the change that I enjoy most. I've realized that this paints a larger picture for my outlook on my life as well as my business. My work is all project based and it changes regularly. The products I work on, the people I work with - they're like the seasons. They come and go. I enjoy them all and could never be content with just one.

Some people have favorites and want a consistent steady thing. Not me. I like the change.

# How to Change Your Screenshot Capture Location

1. Create a new folder on your desktop called `newfoldername`.
2. Open Terminal
3. Type the following command (change `mds` to your own user name): `defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/mds/Desktop/newfoldername`
4. Now type `killall SystemUIServer`
5. You are done. Enjoy your clutter-free desktop.

You can substitute *newfoldername* for any folder name you'd like. If you want to revert back, follow the same steps above, but remove `newfoldername` in Step 3.

I found out how to do this [here](http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/terminal_101_changing_screenshot_capture_location).

# Circles 2014

![circles](/content/images/2014/Oct/1971369_317707731734742_523994639_n.jpg)

I wrote most of this on the plane, flying back from Dallas, after a fun-packed week of conversation, inspiration, and some hardcore [paintball](http://instagram.com/p/tLyGG0EFDM/). Now, over a month later, I’ve finally decided that I need to finish this post before it dies and sad lonely death in my drafts folder. 

---

*Inspiration* is the main theme of [Circles](http://circlesconference.com) and [Ish](http://twitter.com/burciaga) has done an incredible job, once again, of making this a reality. Each detail is impeccable, from the paper coffee cups with Kyle Steed drawings, to the gold foil printed programs filled with Matt Stephens' illustrations. The t-shirts, banners, flyers, napkins, signage; it was incredibly well thought out and a joy to have experienced.

Perhaps the biggest takeaway for me, and a common thread through this year's talks, is how vital personal side projects are to doing the work that you want. Both this year and last, I left inspired with a new sense of purpose to carry through with my side projects. 

For me now, those consist of designing branding and collateral for my friends’ cycling team, designing my first full typeface, and working on some in-depth Adobe Illustrator UX design tutorials.

When you start a side project you have full creative control, and if it fails, there's no one to blame but yourself. It's easy to complain about certain clients or certain type of client work, but with side projects there is no scapegoat. You choose the type of work you want to do, the style you want to do it in, and what the deadline is. You can do anything you want. It's freeing, but the freedom can be paralyzing if you don't set up some constraints.

Constraints are the secret sauce of successful side projects. Here's a quick snapshot of some of the side-projects mentioned at Circles.

- [Vintage ticket inspired t-shirt line from The Heads of State](http://pilotandcaptain.com/collections/shirts)
- [*I’d Rather Be Short* book by Becky C. Murphy](http://chipperthings.com/ratherbeshort/)
- [Self-initiated logo projects that transformed Matt Lehman's career.](http://mattlehmanstudio.com)
- [Daily Drop Caps by Jessica Hische](http://www.dailydropcap.com)

Each one of these projects were non-paying projects, burning precious non-billable hours, yet they blazed a new path for each person committed to seeing them through. It's amazing that with a few boundaries, a little elbow grease, and consistent effort you can change the course of your career, and the type of work you do. You already have permission, no one needs to give it to you.

Last year after leaving Circles, I decided to work some more on a post-only Craigslist app idea that I had been tinkering with. It was because of that side-project that I designed the [float label](http://mattdsmith.com/float-label-pattern). If that would have been a client project or different circumstances, I might not have had the freedom or the time to explore new concepts for form handling interactions.

Nearly 5 years ago, a friend and I built a real estate web application for showcasing property listings. It was during that side project that I designed my first iPhone app, which wouldn't have been added to my portfolio otherwise via client work. Though we pulled the plug on that project a year later, it was those designs that helped me land a big contract job through another agency, as the creative lead on the AT&T U-verse mobile app. That app design led to another mobile project and another, and now iOS design is a large part of the work I do. 

My career has continually evolved as a result of the work that I’ve chosen to do and not to do. There is always a choice. Times will come where those choices are harder to make and its definitely not feasible to start off doing only the work you want to do, but the bottom line is this:

>It’s up to you.

It’s up to you to do what you want. You are responsible to find out how to make what you want to do work. Squeeze it in. Stay up a little later, get up a little earlier, whatever works.

Have you set aside time to do the work that really gets you excited?

# Confidence

My olive-oil covered face dripped with sweat. The scorching sun beamed down on my back. Dousing my head with cold water never felt better.

My dad has been a crop-duster for over 30 years and during the hot and muggy summers in south Georgia, I'd work for him. "Paying my dues," as he so rightly called it during my teen years.

The main task was pouring chemicals into a mixing rig outside of his hangar that would be eventually be loaded into his big 502 Air Tractor. The olive oil, as sucky as it was to put on my face (and arms), protected my skin from the fumes of the pyrethroid-based insecticides used for killing worms, bow-weevils, and other critters that like to eat up farmers' crops. The chemicals are super concentrated and super potent. A gallon or two is usually sufficient to cover 100+ acre fields. The times I neglected to cover my skin, the fumes would cause a mild chemical burn that would literally last all day long. There was nothing I could do to stop the burning other than wait it out for about 24 hours. It was less of a "burn" and more of a hot/cold sensation that just nagged affected areas until passing on its own.

I did at one point fashion a Darth Vader-like head covering made from a welding helmet, duct tape, and a trash bag. "Brilliant!" I thought, at the time of creation, but the heat plus the sight-hindering qualities made for a cranium contraption that was much less awesome. This chemical mixing task allowed for a lot of "me time." Each load took roughly an hour for my Dad to go spray and fly back, so I had plenty of opportunity to get creative.

With the chemicals mixed, time would pass and I'd eventually hear the soft distant roar of his bright yellow plane with a blue stripe on the tail. Not to be confused with the other local crop-duster's bright yellow plane with the diagonal blue triangle on its tail. Once Dad would land and taxi over to the hangar, it was go time.

First I'd drag the beefy hose up to the bottom of the airplane, get it connected, and run back to turn on the pump. It would take 10 minutes or so to pump 400+ gallons from the mixing rig to the airplane, so to be as efficient as possible, I'd drag the gas hose over to the plane as well, climb up onto the wing from the front tire and begin to fill up the tank with fuel. Interesting side note: The plane uses high octane jet fuel, which is basically straight up kerosene. It's used because the freezing point is around -52º F and the auto-ignition point is around 410 °F. You don't want it freezing if it's too cold or spontaneously combusting if it gets too hot. It smells like diesel and the exhaust of the plane blows the hot fumes right where you need to stand on the wing to pump gas. If you have a chemical burn on your face, the spinning airplane propeller plus the exhaust makes for a really loud and less than desirable situation.

While the chemicals were still pumping and the gas started flowing, I'd jump up onto the hopper (the plane equivalent of standing on a truck's hood) and spray down the windshield with sweet smelling Pledge. After squirting a few high-pressured swaths with the lemony spray, the entire surface would be covered with foamy residue. Bug guts stuck to the fiberglass windshield were inevitable after an hour-long session of dusting crops a few feet from the ground. The sun would bake them into place on the glass and Pledge proved to be the best product for their removal.

Once the windshield was clean, I'd hop down quickly, remove the gas nozzle, run over to the mixing rig and wait for Dad's signal to shut off the pump. "Alright, hooooooo!" Dad would say, over the loud noise of the running airplane engine and fiercely spinning propeller. With the mixing rig turned off I'd run back under the airplane and disconnect the pump hose and pull it away. Dad would taxi back out to the runway and take off for another hour. 

During the busy months (June, July, and August) the plane would run all day long from sunrise to dusk, sometimes logging over 1,000 acres sprayed in a single day. There was a GPS on Dad's airplane that showed the spray pattern of the target field that he could print off and give to the farmer. Pretty freaking cool.

It was during these summers when I would make use of my Dad's hangar, which also housed a full wood-working shop, all sorts of tools, saws, belt-sanders, etc. If I wanted to make something, this was the place to do it and Dad was the man to help. We even did body work on cars together in his "shop," as we called it. 

The car we first painted together was my yellow 1979 Mazda RX7, which was a hand-me-down from him. When I first inherited the car as a young 15 year old whipper-snapper, it was not in great shape. The seats were torn, the body paint was chipped and rusty in some places, and instead of a proper cassette or CD player, it had a CB radio - the kind with a walkie talkie device and a curly-q chord attached to the unit. Apparently that was cool to have back in the early 80s. Despite all this, I still thought the car was sweet and just needed some TLC. I asked my Dad if he thought we could install a CD player, even though the front and rear speakers were pretty much non-existent. He assured me that it was possible. Even though I had no idea how he was going to do it, I trusted him. He was always good with that sort of thing.

Before I was born he taught electronics in the US Army during Vietnam. He's always been able to build and make things since I can remember. He's built cars and airplanes from kits, disassembled and reassembled engines, and performed countless other feats of creation and assembly. Because of these accomplishments, my confidence in my Dad was high and I was eager to see the process of installing a CD player and speakers unfold before my inexperienced eyes.

We both sat in the car analyzing our plan of attack. Well he was analyzing, I was just taking note. The interior of the Mazda always had that old worn out leather smell. The kind of smell that's seems different in the cold morning versus the hot afternoon. That same smell still reminds me of being at the airport with him. 

"Help me pop out this dashboard," he said as my eyes widened with anxiousness. "What!?" I said in disbelief. "We can't just pop out the dashboard, can we?" He smiled and said, "Well someone put it in there, right? That means we can take it out and put it back in."  

It was this one statement that has stuck with me ever since. "Someone put it in there and we can take it out." This phrase seemed to unlock something in my mind. It was empowering. It was invigorating. All of a sudden I was tapping into some world that I had not seen before. A world where I could begin to master things, create things, and break things if I wanted. The fact that one human being performed a certain task meant that I could perform that very same task if I wanted too. If some man installed that dashboard in a factory, that meant I could pop it out. I could use my hands to reverse what had been done by someone else's. If someone had done something, anything, I could do it too.

After learning all about power supply, remote switches, speaker wires, soldering, and heat-shrink tubing, I went on to install countless other CD players and speaker systems in friends' cars and trucks throughout high school. I even made a little cash by getting equipment wholesale and selling it to friends. Each new stereo installation was like this big problem just waiting to be solved. Where would I run the 8 gauge power wire from the battery to the back of the CD player? How could I run the amp wires between the seats so nothing is showing when it's finished? I loved it. I ran into plenty of problems for sure, but I always remembered that somehow it could be completed.

It's still mysterious to me why this one seemingly mundane task was such a milestone, but to this very day, fifteen years later, it still remains a pivotal shift in my thinking. It was this seed of thought that has flourished and driven me as I've matured and gotten older. My perception of what is possible has been greatly enlarged by that process. Compact disc sound quality was most certainly the goal, but the most unexpected and delightful byproduct was Confidence.

Someone else had done it and now, so could I. Thanks Dad.

# 4 Frameworks for Writing that Converts

I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts lately and there’s one in particular that I’ve gone back and listened to 4 times, Pat Flynn’s Smart Passive Income [podcast]((http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/copywriting-frameworks/)) with copywriting king, [Ray Edwards](http://rayedwards.com).

Even though this episode was heavily focused on copywriting and understanding a reader’s thought process, the tactics can apply to **UX strategy** and **interface design** in a BIG way.

---

## 1. The OPEN Framework
First, Ray shared an acronym for judging someone’s interest in a  product. Think about your app, or website, or online course, really anything that you’re making or working on that you hope to get people to buy or use.

### **O** is for Oblivious
The oblivious person is the guy eating dinner with his family and the vacuum cleaner salesman knocks on the door trying to make his pitch. It’s really hard to sell someone that has no internal desire whatsoever to buy your product, or download your app, or sign up for your thing.

### **P** is for Pondering
The pondering person has thought in the past, “Hmm I might need a new vacuum cleaner.” This makes things a little easier, but still not ideal to try to convince someone who is merely pondering.

### **E** is for Engaged
The engaged person is the person in the vacuum cleaner store looking for a new vacuum cleaner. You can gather that this person is much more likely to buy than the previous two.

### **N** is for Need
This is the person coming to the emergency room with a bleeding neck. They need treatment NOW. The dinner party is starting in 1 hour, the carpet is filthy and the vacuum cleaner is broken. They NEED a vacuum cleaner. This is the ideal person to sell to.

>This is the person you want in mind when you write your copy, design your call to actions, and more. Think about the quickest and safest way you can convert them from a frowny face to a smiley face.

---

## 2. The PASTOR Framework
In this section Ray gave another acronym, P.A.S.T.O.R. The original definition of **pastor** was means "to be like a shepherd."

Think of shepherding your users or readers to the decision you want them to make, in a way that is helpful and not harmful. Persuasive, but not manipulative. 

Persuasion comes from channeling someone's existing internal desires, whereas manipulation is outside pressure that did not originally exist. 

### **P** is for the Person and the Problem
You want to know everything you can about the person you are writing and designing for.

Hmmm, sounds a lot like user research, right? The more data points and info you have about a person, the better you can build empathy for that person. And the better you can understand how your app, website, book, can help them.

### **A** is for Amplification
This is where you want to amplify the person’s problem. Not in a fear-mongering way, but in a reality check sort of way. Ask them...

>What if your problem of X never gets solved? What would happen? What is a future like with this problem solved versus this problem being 10X worse than it is now?

### **S** is for Story
From tragedy to triumph. This might be the origin story of the problem you now know how to solve, or how your came up with the idea for you app. Tell your success story here. 


### **T** is for Testimony
Your testimony is your proof.

>I did X and lost 20 lbs. I took this course and now I can code. I made these icons and they’re incredibly helpful for my designs.

Whatever positive result happened as a part of your story is the testimony. Ray points out that there are typically 3 levels of proof you need.

1. Have you done this before? Did it work for you?
2. Have you helped others with this before? Did it work for them?
3. Is it possible that you could help me with this also?

The concept of offering something for free up front is one of the best ways to achieve the answer to all three of these questions. If you can give you users or readers results in advance with your product, then they will need less convincing otherwise. This is why the freemium model has worked so well for web-based products. Try before you buy.

### **O** is for Offer
Your offer is the result that your product provides. The offer behind P90X isn’t a bunch of DVDs and a nutrition guide. The offer is chiseled abs and a defined physique. Ray suggests focusing 80% of your writing efforts on the result and 20% of your messaging on what exactly you’ll receive.


### **R** is for Response and Results
This is the moment of glory. The ask. What do you want your user or reader to do. Ask them for it. Not in a pushy way, but in a problem-solving and ethically persuasive way. Remind them of the pain in saying no and the pleasure in saying yes. What will life be like when they implement your solution.

---

## 3. The SPIN Framework
In this section Ray is specifically talking about writing copy for emails. All of this content is great, but I think doubly so if you consider the same factors when designing a website or app.

### **S** is for State
This is the current *state* of your user or reader. Are they really eagerly waiting to read the email you send them? Do they really *want* to go through your app’s on-boarding process and read about new features? Think about the daily routine context of where your user is and what they’re doing when you ask them to give you their attention.

### **P** is for Purpose
Ray says each email should have a purpose behind it. This applies directly to each of the screens you design as well. Each screen should have crystal clear purpose behind it.

### **I** is for Idea
Tied closely to purpose is the idea. What’s the ONE big idea behind the email you’re sending? Likewise, what’s the ONE big idea you’re trying to solve with your design. Does it make sense or is it annoyingly difficult to digest?

### **N** is for Next
What should they do next. Don’t leave it up in the air. Provide a button to press or a link to click. Something that explicitly says “now do this.” True for writing persuasive copy and designing UI screens.

---

## 4. The 7P Framework
Before moving fully into the 7Ps, Ray pointed out you need to be solidly aware of your most desired outcome with your writing (or designs) and the *why* behind it. You should also be able to state your *why* and *cta* in a single sentence.

Some of these ideas overlapping with each other from the other frameworks, but each of them alone provides a unique perspective to use as a starting point for your project. 

Here are the 7P’s…

### **P1** is for Provoke
Being provocative. This might be a headline that stirs up interest, whether it’s your email subject line or a certain section within your app. You want to build curiosity out of the gate.

### **P2** is for Problem
Again with the problem. You need to be able to clearly expose the problem your user or reader is having. This will help frame your messaging and designs in a clear and actionable way.

### **P3** is for Personal
Make the experience personal. Tell your personal story of tragedy to triumph. When I’m designing UI, I like to think of every interaction a conversation between friends. If two people were chatting about the same interactions, what language would they use? What little jokes would be made, if any? I’ve found this is a great exercise for crafting friendly UIs.

### **P4** is for Promise
This is what you’re saying you’ll deliver if the deal is sealed. If the purchase is made or the decision to perform an action is taken. Make sure you’re clear about setting expectations with your writing and your designs.

### **P5** is for Proof
The proof is your promise materialized. THIS is what will happen if you XYZ. Here are the testimonies and results experienced by other people.

### **P6** is for Proposal
This is the offer—the time when you make the ask. Buy this thing. Perform this action. After you’ve gone through all of the above, this is the moment of glory.

### **P7** is for Prompt
Prompt is the means by which the reader or user will cross the threshold of your proposal. Clicking a button, filling out a form, sharing on twitter—whatever it is, think hard about just the right prompt for someone to say “yes” to your proposal.

---

Alright. That’s it. 4 frameworks for copy that converts. I’d recommend bookmarking these notes for future use and if you haven’t already, [go listen to the podcast](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/copywriting-frameworks/).

# Creating a Custom Loader with Sass



[shiplify loader](http://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/6410/screenshots/1372429/shiplify-loader.gif)

Above is a Dribbble [shot](http://dribbble.com/mds) I posted last week. You can see the production version [here](http://mds.sh/shiplify/loader). It's a loader I created for one of the main products I've been working on lately, [Shiplify](http://dribbble.com/mds/projects/shiplify).

Virtually every web application is going to take longer than a few seconds to load data and you need to let people know what's going on. There are lots of out of the box progress bars and indicators you can slap on a project, but custom loaders are a nice little touch in an application.

Custom loaders are a way of saying, "Hey man, I know that you're ready for this to be over, but in the meantime here's a little somethin' to let you know I'm thinking of you." It's also a great opportunity to work in some branding.

With my custom loader, I started off creating a prototype of an animated Shiplify logo in Flash, 'cause I'm old school like that. Here's a look at my timeline.

{<1>}![flash timeline]()

I thought about stopping here, converting to a gif and being done with it, but one gif won't cut it when you're dealing with multiple screen sizes, retina displays, etc. Plus, gifs on mobile devices can be quite janky. 

## Markup
The next logical step was to recreate it with code. Here is the markup for the individual pieces. I wanted a light grey background with animated green pieces. Here I'm using divs for the main background pieces and spans for the soon-to-be animated pieces.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mds/8455854.js"></script>

You can see that each block has a `block-global` class as well as it's own unique `block-#` identifier.

## Moving on to the Sass
I created the styles for each piece. The logo is quite simple so this was fairly straightforward. I sized my logo to 100x100 in Photoshop to give me a 1:1 ratio for  percentages to pixels. I needed these for margins and widths, as well as the height percentage for each individual block.



The tricky part was animating the green shapes the same way I created them in Flash. At first I animated each block with the same animation, with a delay set for each one. The problem with this is that after one time through the animation started going crazy if set to infinite.

After a quick pointer from [Jon Suh](http://twitter.com/jonsuh), I realized I needed to space out my keyframes a bit more, much like I had done for my Flash prototype. So I took a screenshot of my timeline in Flash and used that to come up with the proper percentages for the animation.

{<2>}![flash timeline]()

Now that I had that figured out, it was easy to add those percentages to my keyframes in my Sass.

*Sass keyframes*

One last thing that was a bit tricky, was making this thing fully dynamic with the ability to scale up or down in size by the tweaking of a variable.

I knew that the vertical height of each block needed to be 7% in height but each block needed to be rounded to a whole pixel to keep the integrity of the design. After another tip from [Chris Harrison](http://twitter.com/cdharrison), I managed to come up with this little formula to give me what I needed.

*Sass formula for block height*

And there you have it - a custom, reusable and fully scalable loader built entirely with CSS.

{<3>}![shiplify loader]()

The entire project is on GitHub if you want to take a peek. Or better yet, optimize the keyframe code in _animations.sass I sort of hacked that together at the last minute to make it work.

# Curiosity Stronger than Fear

>"I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." - Albert Einstein

My 2 year old daughter, Isa, got some washable crayons intended for drawing on the walls of the bathtub. This immediately prompted a desire for her to take an usually timed bath in the middle of the day.

Despite my lack of desire, I gave in and got her all setup. I wrote her name on the wall to give her the idea of what to do, then watched in awe as she drew lines and swirls without hesitation.

![isa drawing](http://distilleryimage2.ak.instagram.com/1b9a7c2e732911e3acac12028b21aaf6_8.jpg)

I'm always intrigued to watch kids draw. They seem to have a carefree unexpected style to their ways. A style that's hard to replicate as an adult crippled with fears and insecurities.

I watched the soft purple wax of the crayon press into the squeaky plastic tub wall. A big line, a small swirl then an intense watery scribble.

For some reason this reminded me of the board game, Pictionary, and how lots of people who play feel the need to explain to the others that they "can't draw."

The fear of people seeing their raw drawing skills is stronger than the curiosity of their ability for the same task. For the child the opposite is true. They are curious, not fearful at a ripe young age. They want to see the colors mix and blend, try out a new crayon in the bathtub, write on walls, and more.

Isa, unashamedly pressed the tiny drawing untensil onto the surface. I examined the scribbly bathtub canvas now covered in waxy art and was reminded how great it is to jump into something and get started because of an innocent and strong curiosity, free from fear and doubt.

How many times do we fail to start (or finish) something because of fear?

Just like my daughter (_and Albert Einstein_), I want my curiosity to be stronger than my fear in all that I choose to do. 

Here's to a curious 2014.

# Daughters

![Isa](http://distilleryimage7.ak.instagram.com/e898cacc68e411e3a0620e39fd499eff_8.jpg)

When I get home from work, it's a toss up as to whether or not my wife is completely worn out from being with our kids all day long. She stays at home with all of our kids, which is incredibly demanding.

It's a luxury for her to go to the grocery store alone. So as often as I can I take over all of the kid duties so she can enjoy some solitude.

One day after I got home from work, she went out to run some errands and I took my three kids to Barnes and Noble. They've got a pretty swanky kids section if you've never been.

After making our way to the back and getting settled in probably the germiest area of the store, we gathered some books to flip through.

So as they are looking around, some other young girl, probably 5 or 6 years old, comes and sits awkwardly close to me and starts loud commentary on her book directed at me. "Oh my goodness, look at that princess' hair!" she says to me as she scoots closer.

Now I'm all about being friendly and I love kids, but I didn't want this little girl to get the impression that it's ok to sit beside strange men and get all super friendly with them. So I try to be nice, but casually get up and move closer to my kids. 

This little girl, with super cute blonde hair and dimples, follows me over to my new spot a few benches over. But instead of sitting next to me, she tries to sit in my lap! This is obviously something that just can't happen, so I say, "No, no, why don't you sit over here?" pointing to a nearby spot. "Oh, ok," she says as she moves over to a seat that isn't already taken.

But she is still talking to me more than I'm comfortable with. Not because I mind talking to her, but because I'm a grown man and she is a small child - this is not a good habit for her to learn. It would be different if her mom or dad was sitting there too, but no one was nearby.

At this point I'm looking around to spot who she is with and why they aren't watching her more closely. I finally see her mom and as I suspected, didn't see a wedding ring. This little girl was desperate for my attention. She was desperate for attention from a man.

Soon I moved to another chair where she couldn't possibly sit by me. This little girl then starts doing ballerina twirls and such, flinging her arms inches from my face, desperate to peel my attention from the book I was flipping through.

My heart was slowly breaking for her. As a father I want my children to know how much I cherish them and love them - how valuable they are to me.

Here is this little girl using every tactic she knows to try and win me over. I suppressed my fatherly instincts, knowing that this girl doesn't need a strange man's attention, she needs her father's.

She stops dancing to go look at another book. She says, "I wish miracles were real... I just really wish they were real." She goes on to say, "I just don't think it's going to work out with my mom and my dad in Texas." My heart continued to break for her.

I have two boys and a daughter of my own and it's funny how my daughter wants my attention in a very different way than my boys. She loves being lavished with attention, to be told she is beautiful, and that her outfit is so pretty. She thrives on that attention. 

To see this other little girl in a book store, hoping to be noticed by a strange man, gives me a serious reality check. My daughter needs me more than I can imagine. Someone to protect her, to love her, to be there for her and tell her how beautiful she is. She is desperate for her father's love.

Do you have a daughter? She desperately needs your love and attention. Give it to her.

# Daydreaming of Epicurrence

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/epicurrence-back.jpg)

I went on my first ski trip when I was a teenager. It took a solid day to learn the ropes of speeding down a mountain on a pair of sticks, but I was hooked. At that point in my life I had gone scuba diving, water skiing, played nearly every sport, and various other X Game-like activities. None of that compared to the feeling of sliding effortlessly down snowy slopes. To this day, those ski trips I took as a teenager evoke some of the fondest *adrenaline rush* memories I have. There’s nothing quite like it.

When I saw [Dann](http://twitter.com/dannpetty) announce [Epicurrence](http://epicurrence.com) on Twitter I scrolled through the site with giddiness. 

>“OMG, this would be amazing,” my inner-snow-ski-loving-teenager thoughts emerged. “A freaking conference in the mountains at Lake Tahoe!? With Marc Hemeon, Daniel Burka, Ben Cline, Phil Coffman, Tobias Van Schneider, Jon Lax, Meg Robichaud, and Dann Petty?”

All of this combined foreshadowed a truly epic occurrence indeed. 

My initial excitement was quickly displaced by a heavy feeling of reluctance. I already had travel plans for March and there was no way I would feel good about trying to convince my wife, who stays at home with our [four](/four) kids, that I needed to travel for yet *another* week in March, to attend *another* conference. A few days went by and I never mentioned it to her.

After letting go of the possibility of attending, I received an email from Dann personally inviting me to Epicurrence. “What!?” I was flattered, but still felt reluctant. Dann and I have known each other and communicated regularly through Twitter, Dribbble, etc. for the last 5 years or more, but had yet to meet in person. His email was enough motivation to at least mention it to my wife, my extremely wonderful wife, who shared my excitement followed by a mutual reluctance.

Long story short, we talked it over and she agreed that it was an amazing opportunity so she gave me the green light to go. I would never do something like this without her full support.

## The Arrival
After flying into Reno from Athens, I caught a ride to the Epic House with [Aaron Wade](http://twitter.com/areus). The houses were indeed epic, nestled in the woods within walking distance to the the ski lift that we’d all be taking soon to head up the mountain.

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/epic-house.jpg)

We all kind of congregated out front, watching our Twitter stream come to life right before our very eyes. Some people I recognized instantly– [Tobias Van Schneider](http://twitter.com/schneidertobias) who’s beard is quickly dwarfed by his stellar personality, [Josh Austin](http://twitter.com/joshaustin) who's a total kindred spirit and a fellow father of four, [Jonathon Moore](http://twitter.com/moore), [Phil Coffman](http://twitter.com/philcoffman), [Charlie Waite](http://twitter.com/charliecwaite), [Matt Spiel](http://twitter.com/thinmatt), and more.

For others it took me several minutes before I realized who they were– I’m looking at you [Anthony Lagoon](http://twitter.com/alagoon)! 

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/meet-greet-2.jpeg)

As we waited Dann and a few others were filling backpacks for everyone with the swaggiest swag that I’ve ever swagged before.

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/bags.jpeg)

Their contents included:

- Topo's Backpack  
- Patagonia Nano Hoodie Jacket w/ Epicurrence Patch 
- American Apparel Epicurrence T-Shirt 
- 2 Day Lift Tickets to Heavenly Ski Resort 
- 2 Epicurrence Stickers 
- 1 Epicurrence Patch 
- 2+ Fairends Custom Hats 
- 2 Thermos from InVision 
- 1 Cliff Bar 
- 2 Pack hand warmers 
- 1 Keep Tahoe Blue Sticker 
- The Great Discontent Issue 2 
- A personal hand written thank you note by Dann
- 1TB Western Digital My Passport Hard Drive with 240+ Photos from the Event Pre-Installed 

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/swag.jpeg)

Everyone putting on the gear from the beginning was an amazing way to start things off and very symbolic of the unity that was experienced by everyone at Epicurrence. It felt more like a family reunion than it did a conference even though I only knew a handful of people to start with.

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/swag-on.jpeg)

We made our way inside to get ready for the night’s activities.

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/group.jpg)

## The Sessions
The *speakers* were more conversation leaders than presenters. Every session, day and night, had a down to earth vibe that was raw and honest. Everyone would ask questions and the path of conversation was led by anyone who wanted to contribute. Once the sessions were over, everyone hung out and landed in deep and interesting conversations that were an extension of what was already happening. 

There where so many wonderful conversations I can't possibly recount them all and [Rigel St. Pierre](http://twitter.com/rigelstpierre) did a wonderful job facilitating our group and keep everyone on track.

We’d crash for the night, hit the slopes, and do it all over again. Here are some shots of each session. 

### Designer State of the Union
A great kickoff session for the night with [Meg Robichaud](http://twitter.com/megdraws), [Katy Dill](http://twitter.com/lil_dill), [Marc Hemeon](http://twitter.com/hemeon), [Geoff Teehan](http://twitter.com/gt), and [Adam Michela](http://twitter.com/soopa).

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/designer-panel-1.jpeg)

### Are Design Agencies Dead?
Extremely insightful talk discussion with [Ben Cline](http://twitter.com/yocline), [Tobias Van Schneider](http://twitter.com/schneidertobias), and [Jon Lax](http://twitter.com/jonlax). We got to hear first hand the pros, cons, struggles, and decisions made at various agencies as well as what the future holds for the agency service model.

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/agency-dead.jpeg)

### The Grid Evolution
[Dan Tocchini](http://twitter.com/d4tocchini) and [Leigh Taylor](http://twitter.com/lat) from [The Grid](https://thegrid.io) are taking on a truly gigantic task, automating the design of websites. They’re building an artificially intelligent system that can handle a freakin’ lot of information thrown at it and make decisions based on the input. This will be really exciting to keep an eye on.

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/the-grid.jpeg)

### Daniel Burka and Marc Hemeon
Wonderful raw and honest discussion with [Marc Hemeon](http://twitter.com/hemeon) and [Daniel Burka](http://twitter.com/dburka). That’s all I’ve got to say about that. *#thenest*

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/marc-daniel.jpeg)

### Ben Cline and Eric Atwell
So good hearing from Ben Cline and Eric Atwell from Rally Interactive– their thoughts behind motion design, dealing with clients, and building an interactive studio.

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/rally.jpeg)

### Fireside Chat
Story time with the whole crew involving diamond energy, gerbils, dolphins, and [Invision](http://invisionapp.com). *#shieldyourface*

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/fireside.jpeg)

### Tobias Van Schneider
It was great hearing [Tobias](http://twitter.com/schneidertobias) discuss his role at Spotify and how he treats side projects. He’s a seriously nice guy with tons of insight.

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/tobias.jpeg)

## The Slopes
I was a pretty decent skier 15 years ago, but haven’t been on the slopes since. I decided to try snowboarding both days at Epicurrence and the struggle was very real. I fell more times than I can count, mostly due to my eagerness to bomb the mountain waaaayyy beyond my current snowboarding skill level. 

![epicurrence](/content/images/2015/03/mds-snowboard.jpg)

The first day I fell on a patch of ice, my shirt flung up, and my soft fleshy back got a nice little raspberry scrape on the lower right side. Apparently it won *best mountain injury*, although it paled in comparison to how sore my entire body was from falling down and getting back up over and over and over for two days straight. I have [no regrets](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/179415/file-255682987-png/images/screen_shot_2013-08-13_at_12.30.11_pm.png).

## Summary
Epicurrence was very appropriately named and I’m truly thankful that I got to be a small part of it. I was really impressed with Dann and how well thought out everything was from the personal chefs whipping up amazing meals to the massages in the evening after a day on the mountain. He’s incredibly down to earth and a super thoughtful guy.

Thanks, Dann!

# Dear Boys, Life is Like Minecraft

![Noah and Justice](/content/images/2013/Nov/noah_justice.jpg)

>Dear Noah and Justice,

>I was driving to work today after taking you to school and was consumed with my thoughts. That's usually what happens when I'm driving. It's the reason I miss turns when I'm going somewhere even if I know the way. Your mom likes to make fun of me for that. I don't mind, it's pretty funny.

>I'm usually thinking things like: What I would do this week to get a certain amount of work done. How I would best manage my time. Which decision would be best for this or that major life thing.

>As I merged into traffic on the loop, I started thinking about you guys. How I want you to know that you can do anything you want with your life. You are so young, bright, and full of energy and enthusiasm. I know you're only 6 and almost 4 right now, but I want to make sure your zealousness doesn't get bridled for unnecessary reasons. I want to make sure that you thrive and flourish and hit the world head on, with full-speed, cautious but confident, careful yet courageous.

>You know Minecraft, right? The game you love to play on the iPhone and iPad. Well, life is like that. An open world ready for you to quite literally, dig into. 

>At your disposal there is wood, dirt, stone, and other things you can use to make cool stuff. You can build a house, dig a tunnel, or make a giant statue of a lego guy. Really whatever you want. You have a blank slate to do anything. Just make sure it's something that you feel is worthwhile. Build it for yourself. For the reason that you want, not what you think someone else will appreciate. Let that be a side effect. 

>You don't always have to start from scratch though. You know how one of your favorite things with Minecraft is to join someone's world and explore what they've built. Like your Aunt Jessica? She's spent a ton of time building crazy things that _she_ likes and she's generous to let you join her world, explore and build new things with her.

>Sometimes you can indeed build from scratch, but often times you can join with someone else and build on what they've started. You don't have to do one or the other. Do both if you want. Either way, there is lots to build, lots to do. And you have the freedom and the power to do whatever you want. 

>Don't get sucked into the idea that you have to build a certain thing or do it in a certain way. There are general guidelines to follow that are helpful; harvesting trees to create wooden palettes, making a pickaxe to harvest stone, making a stone pickaxe to harvest iron, gold, and diamonds. But don't let that hold you back from really going all out with your creation, once you've got the basics. Remember we're talking about Minecraft here, but I want you to think about your life in the same way.

>You are much too young to comprehend this life metaphor right now, but as you grow older under my lead and training, I hope to instill these principles deep within you.

>Oh, also. Just like in Minecraft, Creepers exist in the real world too. It's best to just avoid them when you can. They won't add any value to your life. If you need to, kill them with a sword or build a pit of lava that they'll just blindly walk into, metaphorically speaking of course.

>When you're older, watch the video below and try to make the connections for yourself.

>I love you, 

>Dad

>_PS. I can't wait to play with you today when I get home from work._

# Designing Contrast

![contrast promo image](/content/images/2017/07/contrast-promo-image.jpg)

[Contrast](https://usecontrast.com) is a menu bar app that Sam Soffes and I launched. If you haven't seen it yet, definitely check out [the site](https://usecontrast.com) or [the app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/contrast/id1254981365?mt=12&uo=6&at=1l3vmtU) before reading this post, otherwise it won't make much sense. 

---

[Sam](http://twitter.com/soffes) was at working from my studio for a few days during a motorcycle trip of his across the Southeast.

It was rather serendipitous how we decided to make this app. We kind of just agreed to build after like 1 minute of talking about it. We grabbed dinner the first night he was in town and brainstormed some ideas. I brought my trusty pocket-sized Field Notes journal and pen. 

We were at Ted's Most Best, a place in Athens you should totally go to if you're ever in town.

"Ok, here's what I'm thinking." I told Sam as I put pen to paper. I made a quick little sketch.

![contrast app notebook sketch](/content/images/2017/07/field-notes-contrast.jpg)

This is the one and only drawing I did of the concept. It's also basically the same thing I tweeted to Brent Jackson over a year ago [when I asked if he'd considered making a menu bar app](https://twitter.com/jxnblk/status/717436838282133504) out of his Colorable demo.

![quick mock of brent's colorable demo as a mac app](/content/images/2017/07/tweetatbrent.png)

After discussing with Sam, he felt confident he could get a rough prototype running pretty quickly.

We went back to the studio and within literally 15 minutes or so, he had the WCAG luminance equations and native color pickers working in a rough prototype app.

I don't have a screenshot of that, but it was basically the AA rating on the left with two default mac color pickers on the right.

## The Menu Bar Icon
I like to design interfaces based on moments in time—like the first time it's used versus how it will function with repeated use.

Because of this I started with the menu bar icon. The little 16px tall icon that you click on to show the app.

Here is the original design of the first icon.

![AA menu bar icon](/content/images/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-25-at-5.58.02-AM.png)

![early menu app icon iterations with A's](/content/images/2017/07/menu-bar-iterations.png)

My original concept was an AA icon to represent the color contrast score. Typography by it's nature is typically designed anywhere from 1200pt to 2400pt, so it's not going to be pixel perfect when scaled down to a tiny size, which doesn't work well for a tiny icon.

I redrew the primitive shapes for the tiny As and had it looking pretty decent. Sam suggested trying a contrast-type icon like you would see when editing photos.

More concepts, especially at an early stage are never a bad idea. So I got started on the second concept. After a few minutes I came up with another concept (below).

Menu bar apps need 1x, 2x, and 3x menu bar icons. 

I always find it easier to design for what you're designing on so I designed *for* 2x first, just at a 1x scale.

I designed the small squares on the right to start on a half Y pixel so the spacing would be more vertically even on retina screens. I adjusted to a whole pixel for 1x screens, and exported my half pixel version at 3x.

You can see the subtle half pixel in the spacing below. 

![contrast menu bar icons](/content/images/2017/07/menu-bar-icons.png)

I went ahead and exported these for Sam to test in his prototype. I learned that the constraints for these icons aren't 16x16, they're more like 16xwhatever. You can have a custom width, so I decided to put a little padding on each side and settled on 16x20.

Somewhere along the way Sam needed to name the project inside of Xcode and asked for a name.

Without putting a ton of thought, we decided on simply **Contrast** since that was the most straightforward name of what we were designing for. 

## The App UI

Like any good drawing or painting, it helps to start with solid reference material.

### Starting with Screenshots
I took several screenshots of the the colorable demo, a handful of menu bar apps I use like Cloud app, Dropbox, etc. as well as a few screenshots of the menubar itself with Sketch open.

> PRO TIP: ⌘ + option + shift + 4 is your best friend for tasks like these. Hitting that key combo changes your cursor to crosshairs that allows you to click and drag an area of your screen to make a cropped screenshot. This particular key combo saves the screenshot to your temporary memory instead of saving a file. You can then ⌘ + V the screenshot into your design application of choice.

I've only [designed one other Mac app](https://dribbble.com/mds/projects/465955-MyMonero) and the sizing can be tricky to get right if you haven't done it much before. 12 and 13pt fonts are way more prevalent on desktop apps as opposed to websites or mobile apps. It takes some mental convincing that it's OK to use fonts that size.

The screenshots are really helpful to use for sizing reference.

![dropbox menu bar app](/content/images/2017/07/screenshot1.png)
![craft from invision menu bar app](/content/images/2017/07/screenshot2.png)
![sketch tool panel screenshots](/content/images/2017/07/screenshot3.png)

### Initial designs
Contextual design is always best, so I designed the initial UI directly on top of the menu bar and Sketch screenshots.

I started off by designing pretty much exactly what I had sketched a few hours earlier.

There was a part of me that wanted to over design it with a really large AAA score with lots of negative space. That's what made me love Brent's [version](http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/) so much after all. But that just didn't feel right for a small utility. Websites and desktop applications are two different beasts and require different approaches.

You can see some of the quick initial designs below. They're super rough, but you gotta start somewhere.

![initial designs](/content/images/2017/07/initial-designs.png)

I drew a background rectangle in Sketch and rounded the corners to 6 pixels. Then a used a smaller 20x20 square shape, rotated at 45deg for the small arrow on the top. I knew I'd want to change the color of the entire app background so I merged them as one shape.

![bg shapes](/content/images/2017/07/bg-shapes.png)

### Settling on style
I kept referencing input fields on different Mac apps. Sketch has very native-feeling input fields with square edges and that seemed like a good approach to begin with.

![input field reference](/content/images/2017/07/input-ref.gif)

As I kept tinkering with the designs, nudging pixels here and there, the square input fields just felt harsh for the app. Perhaps it was the round corners of the background and the close proximity of the input fields to the soft edges.

So despite my initial attempts I went with rounded input corners instead. The entire UI would have to be built custom in Xcode anyway's so rounded or not, it didn't matter much.

![final contrast input fields](/content/images/2017/07/contrast-input.gif)

### App Typography
Unless you're building something extremely worthy of custom typography, you really wanna stick with the system fonts. In this case it's SF UI Display and SF UI Text. 

Mac OS will automatically choose SF UI Display for type sizes 20px and higher and SF UI Text for everything smaller.

I originally used SF for all for type instances, the contrast score, the input fields, and the ratio.

In my designs I was simply using `000000` as the hex code place holder, but after a few test using variations on the hex code it was obvious that the character widths between something like `ffffff` was going to be much narrower.

![character width differences between mono and non-monospace fonts](/content/images/2017/07/font-differences.png)

Because of this I opted for a monospace font to keep the six character widths all the same. I went with my friend Mattox's font called, *Native*, which [you can get here for free](https://fortfoundry.com/products/native).

Nothing groundbreaking, obviously, since most people use a monospace font for coding, but something I had to discover in a roundabout kinda way.

## Interface Icons
I had already created the menu bar icon, but now I needed one really good icon for the color picker.

My initial thought was a target or a crosshair type icon. You can see a version of that below.

![target icon](/content/images/2017/07/target-icon.png)

But this just didn't seem right. I liked the concept at first, but it's so engrained in me as a designer that the eyedropper icon is what you click to summon a color picker.

So I took yet another screenshot of Sketch to analyze its color picker icon. I can't recall ever designing a color picker icon like this.

![screenshot of Sketch's eyedropper color picker icon](/content/images/2017/07/sketch-eyedropper.png)

My process for designing icons is always to break down an object into basic geometric shapes when possible. I used 3 rectangles as the base shapes and adjusted from there.

For whatever reason, this particular icon was much trickier to produce than I originally anticipated. Getting the length and width of the tube just right will still falling on whole pixels was perhaps the biggest challenge.

![custom eyedropper icon](/content/images/2017/07/eyedropper-design.gif)

Once I had everything feeling proportional on the eyedropper I put it into a folder and rotated it 45deg. It's always much easier to create icons like this with no rotation and then rotate it once it's ready.

Then if you ever need to adjust the shapes, un-rotate, adjust, then re-rotate. This helps keep the shapes on whole pixels while you tweak it.

## Dynamic color system with symbols
Now that my basic UI ingredients were coming together I needed to organize my components with dynamic symbols. 

We planned for the entire background of the little app to change colors, when picking the background color. Because of this I needed to have at least 2 variations of the UI—dark and light—to account for the range of brightness possibilities. Think full black background or full white background.

The easiest way to manage these variations is with symbols. This would allow me to create multiple versions of the app with different background colors while using the same UI symbols for every instance.

I never like to _start off_ using symbols because I find it to be too constrictive and hindering to the creative process. Symbols are better for production as opposed to creation, at least when starting off.

I wanted all of the components of the UI to butt against one another so it would be easy to re-assemble once everything was a component.

I temporarily removed the arrow from the background of the app so I could measure directly against the large background shape using the `option` key. Otherwise the measurements would extend all the way to the tip of the arrow.

![measuring the background shape with an arrow versus without](/content/images/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-26-at-7.16.34-AM-1.png)

Behind each section of the UI, I drew a background shape and set the fill to `0%`.

> PRO TIP: Using a `0%` fill will allow you to easily select the shape with a click, whereas removing the fill completely will make you're life more difficult.

After drawing the background shapes, I ended up with something like this.

![layers of bg shape](/content/images/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-07-26-at-7.17.28-AM.png)

I also created a symbol for the background of the app, which included the rectangular vector shape and the arrow at the top as one shape. 

![app background shape as a symbol](/content/images/2017/07/dynamic-bg.gif)

Anything part inside of a symbol that needs to be changed dynamically, with the exception of text, needs to be a nested symbol.

So in order to have the background color be dynamic, I created a square color swatch of the same color and made a symbol out of that.

> PRO TIP: Make sure any symbol you want to dynamically change has the same artboard size. If it's not the same size, it won't show up as a suitable replacement

![swatch symbols](/content/images/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-07-26-at-7.18.48-AM.png)

![background shapes behind the components](/content/images/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-26-at-7.19.42-AM.png)

Then I placed the color swatch symbol inside of the app background symbol and masked it with the background shape.

![layers of bg shape](/content/images/2017/07/bg-shapes-1.png)

> Side note: This is the same type of technique [I used to do with Photoshop](http://www.creativebloq.com/photoshop/change-colour-multiple-elements-121413516) way back in the day with smart object color swatches. 

### Symbol Instances
You can see below that I now have a library of all of my symbols and their variations.

![symbol bird's eye view](/content/images/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-26-at-7.12.55-AM.png)

There are active states for both dark and light variations of the input fields for testing purposes. Plus, it's nice to have the flexibility of entering custom HEX codes for later usage in the marketing site design, App Store screenshots, etc. More on that later.

I've recently started using this amazing symbol organizer plugin aptly named [Symbol Organizer](https://github.com/sonburn/symbol-organizer), by Jason Burns. It does away with that never ending row of symbols inside of Sketch.

This has always been kind of painful to deal with as my symbol collection grew. The plugin, along with a specific naming syntax, completely solves this problem.

For example, you can group symbols by having a parent name, backslash, then an instance name. So for the background color swatches I used `color/000000` and so on. The symbol organizer will group symbols based on the parent name to the left of the `/`. Life changing. =)

I encourage you to do what works for you though, and not get too caught up on exact naming conventions.

## Symbol Assembly
OK, now that everything was built out, it was time to reassemble the app using symbols.

I use the [Runner](http://sketchrunner.com/) plugin to quickly insert symbols into my document. So any time I want to insert a symbol I can hit the quick key `⌘ + '`, tab to `insert`, type the symbol name, and hit return.

I did this for every component including the background, the score, the foreground and background controls, and finally the ratio.

![gif of quickly assembling the app with symbols](/content/images/2017/08/building-components.gif)

Now that I had the full app built with symbols, I selected everything and created another symbol out of all of the parts.

This gives me the ability to spawn a new version of the app all over the document. It's also really easy to copy and paste this one symbol into other documents as needed.

![gif of sketch runner in action](/content/images/2017/08/sketch-runner.gif)

## Testing for Background Color Variation
With my one symbol to rule them all built, it was time to layout a bunch of variations for stress testing the UI colors.

We planned to have a luminance *if statement* that would change the UI from dark to light based on the brightness value of the chosen background color. So I needed to make sure the UI wasn't going to break at any given range.

I laid out roughly 12 instances of my `app/flyout` symbol. 

![12 instances of the app symbol the same color](/content/images/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-07-31-at-10.15.44-PM.png)

You can see they're all the same color. Now I went back into the symbols section and created a lot more color symbols using the same `color/hex` naming convention and same artboard size.

I went ahead and changed the background of every symbol making sure that I had a range of dark and light colored backgrounds.

![dynamic app backgrounds](/content/images/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-07-31-at-10.12.24-PM.png)

You can see from here that some of the UI components are starting to get lost, which is where the dark/light variations will help out. 

I wasn't sure of the exact brightness scale of these colors, so I used my best guess as to which one needed light versus dark UI.

![dark and light UI dynamically updated](/content/images/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-07-31-at-10.17.32-PM.png)

> PRO TIP: You can select multiple instances of the same symbol and update nested symbols for every instance at the same time.

![update multiple nested instances at the same time](/content/images/2017/08/dynamic-changing.gif)

## Design Hand-off
Now that the designs were pretty much finalized, it was time to hand-off the files.

I use Dropbox exclusively for all of my digital files and [have an exquisitely organized folder structure for my projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ9om-iogQE). This made it super easy (as always) to instantly share my project with Sam.

I gave a quick walkthrough on how I setup the Sketch file, how the app was built using symbols, and where he could dig into each little piece of UI to find the information he needed.

> PRO TIP: It's always a good idea to talk to your developer early and often about the project you're building. This will dramatically increase the quality and speed of what you build.

It's also worth noting that I used a pretty strict 4px mental system when laying out each component, making sure that every margin was divisible by 4. This is a pretty standard goto system for me. It works well for mobile app design as well as web stuff.

![four pixel grid](/content/images/2017/08/contrast-casestudy.gif)

## The App Store Icon
Ah yes, the beloved icon. We needed this. You know, the one that shows up in the actual App Store, in the Applications folder in Finder, etc. 

Even though this is exclusively a menu bar app, we still needed the icon.

I started off creating a pretty boring black icon with a larger version of the menu bar icon at first.

![the first app icon](/content/images/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-07-31-at-10.38.05-PM.png)

I knew we needed a better one eventually, but we were moving fast and I figured I'd make it better later. I mean, I made it as nice as possible for what it was, it just wasn't great.

In the end, this is what I settled on, but it was only after a big design sprint for the [marketing website](https://usecontrast.com).

![final app icon](/content/images/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-07-31-at-10.38.56-PM.png)

## The Loupe 
Another big part of this little app is the ability to select a color with a loupe-style color picker.

I wanted to be able to pick any color on the screen, the same way you can quickly select a color using `CTRL + C` in Sketch.

Little did Sam know that when I mentioned this feature to him that it would be the bane of his existence.

![app color picker](/content/images/2017/08/loupe.gif)

It turns out, color spaces are pretty complex, and no wonder [Sketch drew a line in the sand](https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/documentation/other/color-management/) with the 45th version of their app.

Entering a hex code in a field is a pretty fool-proof way to get measurements, but picking a color from your screen is 10 times harder, programmatically speaking anyways.

There were issues with the mouse leaving the loupe behind, then issues with wrong HEX codes getting picked during simple color tests.

Finally, after doing things with code that I could only hope my great grandchildren would do, Sam fixed everything with the color picker loupe.

There are still color space issues, but that's more of a general color issue at large rather than a bug in the app. For example the hex codes may be slightly off if used in Photoshop, unless you choose `Display` from color profiles.

But all other tests in Sketch, Figma, Illustrator, and XD passed with flying colors. Pun intended.

Hooray for colors!

## The Sliders
So in [Brent Jackson's colorable demo](http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/), he's got these nifty little HSB sliders. Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. I find myself using the brightness slider the most to tweak and color just above a passing score from time to time.

And because the goal of this app is to stay tiny and out of the way, we decided it would be nice to have a brightness slider, but just leave the other ones out.

![sliders](/content/images/2017/08/slider.gif)

Before launching we decided that this would be better as a later feature. It's not critical for functionality and we did add the arrow key nudge up/down feature, which is almost better in my opinion.

Always best to draw a line in the sand *somewhere* so you can actually ship the product.

## Mo' Testing Mo' Features
The feature ideas really don't stop. It's like a water hose. As soon as I started testing builds of the app and using during actual design projects, I found myself wanting to swap the background and foreground colors.

"I'll just design a little icon for that!" I thought to myself. So I did. Introducing the color swapper button. ;)

My gut said it would be less time consuming than some of our other ideas, so Sam graciously popped it in real quick. Thanks, Sam!

## Sound FX
Back in the day I was OBSESSED with little clicks and pops in Flash websites. I had a huge library of sounds that I completely abused in all of my old and horribly awesome websites.

So when I saw that Glyphish [released some pretty amazing sound effects](http://glyphish.com/sounds/), it rekindled my love for aptly placed sound within an interface. 

> Sidenote: Have you ever noticed how amazing the Facebook sound effects are? I don't see many people talking about sound in UI. Weird? It's an amazing way to add polish to your software.

I bought them and put them in our shared Dropbox folder for Sam to have some fun with. We bounced some ideas back and forth, tested a few out, and ultimately settled on a few little bips and boops all in the name of fun.

## Download the App
Speaking of fun, [you should totally go snag this app](https://usecontrast.com)! We think it's pretty awesome and had a blast making it.

If you're making interfaces in any form or fashion this app was built for you. Designer? Developer? QA person? Yes you. 

You can test the color contrast on design mockups, actual websites, keynote presentations, and anything else that's designed on a Mac.

# Designing Icons in Illustrator

In this post you’ll learn...

1. How to use Illustrator to create cohesive icons for user interfaces.
2. Strategies for designing a full set of icons that work well together.
3. Ways to visualize and draw complex icons using a combination of simple geometric shapes.

### ICONS
- Chevron—4 icons in 1 (line) 
- User (circle, rectangle, corner radius)
- Email (rectangles, path manipulation, line, corner radius)
- Settings (star shape, corner radius)
- Calendar (multiple shapes)
- Lock (shapes, corner radius)
- Edit (rectangle, path manipulation, line)
- Share (rectangle, path manipulation, line)
- Link (shapes, path manipulation)

### Deciding on an icon set style
- What mood do you want to convey? Fun, serious, chunky, elegant, brand specific, etc. Make a decision.
- How lines, weights, shapes can effect voice and tone.
- Review examples from other apps
	- Facebook
	- Pinterest
	- Instagram

### Setting up our artboards
Keep in mind what size you’re designing for (eg. 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, etc.)
	
- Create New Document by hitting `⌘ N`
- Make sure Units are set to `Pixels`
- Set Artboard size to `24px` by `24px`
- Color mode should be set to `RGB`
- Make sure `Grid by Row` is selected. (First icon to the right of the artboard input)
- Set Number of Artboards to `8`
- Set Spacing to `10px` 
- Now press `OK`
- Hit `⌘ S` to open the Save As modal.
- Select `Desktop` from the sidebar and hit `⌘ Shift N` to create a new folder.
- Name the folder `MAX Icons`.
- Now hit `⌘ Shift N` again to create a subfolder called `source`.
- Finally, change the `Save As:` field to `MAX-icons-MDS-v0.1`, but replace `MDS` with your own initials.
- Hit `Save` and then `OK`.

### Quick Key Cheat Sheet
- `F` will toggle the view mode of your Illustrator document. Hit `F` once to go full screen.
- Holding down `Spacebar` will activate the Hand Tool. I recommend using your left thumb for this action.
- Holding down `⌘ Spacebar` will activate the Zoom Tool. I recommend using your left middle finger for `⌘` and your left pointer finger for `Spacebar` will zooming.
- Drag right to Zoom In
- Drag left to Zoom Out

It’s normal to change hand position on the keyboard frequently while using Illustrator. Kind of like driving a manual transmission—awkward at first, but you’ll get used to it in no time. 

- `⌘ 0` will zoom to the current artboard to your screen size.
- `⌘ 1` will zoom your document to 100%. Helpful to see the  true size of your design.
- `⌘ Shift H` will toggle the visibility of your artboards.
- `⌘ U` to toggle Smart Guide visibility. Hovering an anchor or a path will show a corresponding label.
- `M` Rectangle Tool
- `L` Ellipse Tool
- `\` Line Tool
- `R` Rotate Tool
- `V` Selection Tool
- `A` Direct Selection Tool
- `P` Pen Tool
- `⌘ D` to duplicate last action
- `⌘ Shift M` to activate Move Modal
- `⌘ Y` to toggle Outline Mode
- `⌘ E` to toggle GPU vs CPU mode. GPU is faster. CPU renders better. Work in GPU. Preview in CPU.
- `⌘ G` to group objects.
- `⌘ Shift G` to ungroup objects.
- `⌘ '` to toggle gridlines.

### Setting up Reference Gridlines
Gridlines aren’t absolutely critical, but they facilitate a simple framework and provide a quick visual reference so you can make sure your icons are consistent with one another.

- Hit `⌘ K` to open Illustrator preferences
- Select `Guides & Grid` from the left menu
- In the “Gridline Every:” field enter `4px`
- In the “Subdivisions” field enter `8px`
- Select `OK`

You can use `⌘ ‘` to toggle the pixel grid visibility.

The gridline sizes are mostly personal preference, but this should give you a good starting point.

### Designing a Chevron Icon
- Press `⌘ M` to activate the Rectangle Tool
- Click anywhere on the first artboard (top left) and you’ll see the Rectangle modal appear
- Enter `12px` x `12px`
- Press `OK`
- Press `V` to activate your Selection Tool
- Select your rectangle if it’s not selected already
- Give your rectangle a fill of `[None]` and a black stroke 
- In the `Stroke` panel (`Window > Stroke`) set the “Weight” to be `2pt`.
- Now select `Round Cap` and `Round Join` in the Stroke Panel (This is personal preference depending on the style of icon set you are creating.)
- Move your rectangle to the center of your artboard
- The Smart Guides will help with alignment
- Alternatively, you can use the `Align` panel found under `Window > Align` to center your rectangle
- With the `Align` panel open, press the icon in the lower right beneath the label `Align To:` and select `Align to Artboard`
- Now press the `Horizontal Align Center`, then `Vertical Align Center` icons.
- Now that your rectangle is centered, hover just above the top right anchor point until the cursor changes to a quarter-circle icon.
- Click and drag down while holding `Shift` to rotate 45º degrees.
- Press `A` to activate your Direct Selection Tool
- Select the leftmost anchor point of the rectangle and hit `delete`
- Press `V` to activate your Selection Tool and position your new icon in the center of the artboard.
- Now you’ve got your right chevron

### Creating 3 Chevrons from 1
- Select your newly created Chevron with the Selection Tool `V`
- Click and `Option + Shift Drag` to the middle of the next artboard using its center registration point. This will make a copy of your shape and constrain it horizontally while you drag it into place.
- Now press the `R` key to activate the Rotate Tool. You’ll see the cursor change to cross hairs. Click once on the shape’s center registration point. This defines the point of rotation.
- 	Click the top anchor point of the path and drag clockwise 180º.
- Now you’ve got your left chevron
- Repeat the same steps from above to create an “Up” chevron and a “Down” chevron on the next two artboards.
- PRO TIP: You can hit `⌘ D` to duplicate any previous action in Illustrator.

### Designing a Profile Icon
- Pan down to the next artboard using the `Spacebar` 
- Press `L` to activate the Ellipse Tool
- Click on the artboard and you’ll see the Ellipse modal appear.
- Enter `10` x `10`
- Position the new ellipse in the top center of the artboard.
- In `Window > Transform`, make sure that the ellipse shape has `Align to Pixel Grid` selected. This will help keep things nice and crisp.
- PRO TIP: A 2pt stroke aligned to the pixel grid will fall on a whole X and Y coordinate, while a 1pt stroke will fall on a half pixel X and Y coordinate. 
- Press `M` to activate the Rectangle Tool
- Click on the artboard and enter `18px` x `8px`
- Position the rectangle in the bottom center of the artboard
- Nudge the top circle and bottom rectangle slightly until their paths intersect on the same horizontal line. The bottom most path of the circle should be on the same horizontal line as the top most path of the rectangle.
- Press `A` to activate the Direct Selection Tool
- Draw a section over the top left anchor point of the rectangle
- Hold `Shift` and select the top right anchor point
- With both of the top anchor points selected and the Direction Selection Tool still activated, hover your cursor over the circular icon on the inside of either of the top anchor points. Your cursor will show a small rounded path icon beside it when it’s correctly positioned.
- Click and hold one the circular icons and drag the corners done until the radius is maxed out at 8px.
- Now for some style points, click the rectangle’s bottom path and hit `delete`. This will remove part of the rectangle, but leave the other pieces intact. 

### Designing an Email Icon
- Press `M`, click on the next artboard and enter `18px` by `14px`, align to pixel grid, and position it in the center of the artboard.
- Press `\` to activate the Line Tool and draw a horizontal line   across the rectangle.
- Press `P` to activate the Pen Tool.
- Hover your cursor over the center of the horizontal line. You should see a small `+` icon appear beside the tool tip.
- Click to add an anchor point to the center of the line.
- Press `A` to activate the Direct Selection Tool and select the  left and right anchor points of the line.
- Drag the line anchor points to the top corners of the rectangle shape. The Smart Guides `⌘ U` will help with alignment.
- Click off of your line to deselect it.
- Press `V` to activate your Selection tool and select the V-shaped line.
- Nudge your line segment down a 3 pixels with the `down` arrow key
- Select the rectangle with the Selection Tool
- While the rectangle is selected, press `A` to activate the Direction Selection tool
- Now you have a “Corners” option in the toolbar which should read `0px` by default.
- Change this value to `3px`
- Nudge the line segment down using the `Down` arrow key if the edges now extend beyond the bounds of the rectangle.
- Select both the line and the rectangle with and hit `⌘ G` to group the elements

### Designing a Settings Icon
- Select the `Star Tool` from the tool panel by clicking and holding the `Rectangle Tool` and choosing `Star` from the options.
- Click anywhere on the next blank artboard. 
- In the Star Modal, set `Radius 1` to `11px`, set `Radius 2` to `8px`, and set points to `8`.
- In `Window > Transform`, make sure that the star shape selected has `Align to Pixel Grid` selected.
- Also, make sure the `X` and `Y` coordinates, as well as the height and width are **whole numbers** and not decimals.
- Draw a selection around the entire star with the Direct Selection Tool `A`
- In the top application toolbar set `Corners` to 2px.
- Now, hit `L` for the Ellipse tool, click on the artboard and enter `6px` by `6px`
- Make sure the Ellipse has `Aligned to Pixel Grid` selected in the Transform Panel.
- Select both the star and ellipse with the Selection Tool `V`.
- With both shapes selected, click the star shape again. This will increase the selection size, indicating it has been set as a `key object`.
- Now use `Window > Align` or the align tool in the application tool bar to center the small circle horizontally and vertically over the star shape.

### Designing a Calendar Icon
- In a new artboard create an `18px` by `15px` rectangle, align it to pixel grid, and position it in the center.
- Give the rectangle a corner radius of `3px`.
- Create a new `3px` by `5px` rectangle and align it to the pixel grid.
- Press `A` and drag the new shape’s corner radius as far as it will go. It will max out at 1.5px indicated in the `Corners` field in the application toolbar.
- Align the new rectangle’s center point with the top of the large rectangle. Because the height has an odd number of 5px it won’t snap directly to the path, so let it go just above.
- Nudge the rounded rectangle `4px` to the left.
- 	Now `Option + Shift Drag` the new rectangle to the right `7px`.
- Double click the large rectangle to enter `Isolation Mode`. All other objects on the canvas will be greyed out when Isolation Mode is activated.
- Hit `⌘ Y` to view `Outline Mode`. This is also accessible from `View > Outline Mode`.
- Press `A` to reveal anchor point locations.
- Zoom in tight to the top left portion of the icon using `⌘ Spacebar`
- Press `P` to activate the Pen Tool.
- Add two points to the center of the top path of the large rectangle. Exact location is not important, just add two.
- Now hit `A` and select one of the new anchor points. Now `Shift Drag` to align the selected anchor point to the left of the small rounded rectangle.
- Now align the second anchor point to the right edge of the rounded rectangle.
- Click the path in between the two new anchor points and hit `Delete`. This should remove ONLY the section of the rectangle between the two new anchor points. If any other part of your rectangle has been deleted, `⌘ Z` until it’s back intact and try again.
- Let’s check our work by hitting `⌘ Y` to exit Outline Mode.
- Double click anywhere on the blank canvas to exit Shape Isolation Mode.
- You should now see an empty space in the center of the left rounded rectangle.
- Now do the same thing to the path behind the right rounded rectangle.
- Double click to isolate large rectangle, `⌘ Y` to view outline mode, add points, delete path segment. Exit outline and isolation mode. Double check your work.
- Draw an 18px horizontal line and place `5px` above the large rectangle’s bottom path.
- Once the top right rounded rectangle looks like the left, select all of the shapes with and hit `⌘ G` to group. 

### Designing a Lock Icon
- In a new artboard draw a `16px` x `14px` rectangle and align to pixel grid.
- Set corner radius to 3px to match the rest of the set.
- Draw a new `8px` by `6px` rectangle and position it above the larger rectangle.
- Select the top two anchor points of the smaller rectangle and drag the corners to be fully rounded at `4px`.
- Draw a `4px` x `4px` ellipse. Align to pixel grid and position it in the center of the large rectangle.
- Select the line tool `\` and click on the artboard.
- 	Enter `2px` for the length and `90º` for the angle.
- Position the line segment centered with, but below the ellipse.
- For any positioning issues, double check the X and Y coordinates are set to a whole number and not a decimal.
- Select and group all of the object on the artboard.

### Designing a Share Icon
- Draw a `16px` x `10px` rectangle and align to pixel grid.
- Select and delete the top path with the Direct Selection Tool `A`
- Select the bottom two anchor points and add a corner radius of `3px`
- Draw a `13px` vertical line, align to pixel grid, and horizontally align it with the open rectangle shape.
- Align the line to the bottom of the open rectangle and nudge it up by `6px` using the up arrow key.
- Draw a `6px` by `6px` rectangle and rotate it 45º.
- Delete the bottom anchor point from the rotated square and position it at the top of the line segment.
- Check alignment and group objects. 

### Designing an Edit Icon
- Draw an `16px` x `16px` rectangle, align to pixel grid, and round corners to 3px.
- With the Pen Tool `P`, add two anchor points. One to the center of the top path and a second to the center of the right path. Make sure the `+` icon is showing when you click to add a point, otherwise you’ll create a new shape. Sometimes a `⌘ Click` is required.
- Select and delete the top right anchor points of the rectangle.
- Select the top center anchor point and nudge `2px` to the left.
- Select the right center anchor point and nudge `2px` down.
- Draw a `4px` x `4px` rectangle.
- `Option + Shift Drag` the rectangle down 4px to create a duplicate.
- Select the bottom two anchor points with the `A` tool and `Shift Nudge` with the down arrow key to move the anchor points down 10px. Nudge back up 2px for a total of 8px. 
- Add an anchor point to the bottom path of the tall rectangle and nudge it down `2px`.
- Select the two shapes and hit `⌘ G`
- Make sure `Align to Pixel Grid` is NOT selected and rotate the grouped shapes 45º. Having the pixels aligned to a grid when rotating shapes can produce weird results.
- Select the grouped pencil shape and the open rectangle. Click the open rectangle shape again to set it as the key object.
- Now align to the top and the right.
- Deselect all shapes.
- Select the grouped rectangles and nudge `1px` up and `1px` to the right.
- 	Select the top right anchor points of the pencil group and nudge `1px` down and `1px` to the left.

### Designing a Link Icon
- Draw a `12px` x `8px` rectangle and max out the corner radius at `8px`.
- Using `A`, select and delete the top right anchor point.
- Select and `Option + Shift Drag` the shape over to the right by `7px`.
- Rotate the duplicate shape `180º`.
- Group the shapes.
- Select the group and rotate `45º`.

### Preparing Your Icons for Export
- Hit `⌘ Shift S` to open the Save As modal. Save your new document as `MAX-icons-flattened-mds-v0.1.ai`, keeping the original as a safe backup.
- Now, make sure you’re working in the `Flattened` file by double checking the title bar in the top of the canvas. Toggle `F` a few times if you need to.
- Hit `⌘ A` to select all objects on the canvas.
- In the Menu, go to `Object > Path > Outline Stroke`. This will convert your stroked paths to shapes with fills.
- Select the shapes on the Profile icon artboard. You’ll notice 2 shapes overlapping each other. 
- Open the Pathfinder `Window > Pathfinder` and select the top left icon, `Unite`, under Shape Modes. This will unite the two shapes into one, creating one shape with one fill.
- 	Repeat this step for the remaining artboards.
- This transforms the multi-layered icons into their own simple, flattened shape. Perfect for SVGs.

### Setting Up a Custom Quick Key for Exporting
- Go to `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts`.
- Click the `Tools` dropdown and select `Menu Commands`.
- Navigate to `File > Export > Export for Screens` and select the `Shortcut` input field.
- Enter `⌘ Option E`
- Hit `OK` 

### Exporting Your Icon Assets
- Hit your new shortcut `⌘ Option E` to open the `Export for Screens` menu.
- You’ll notice all of the artboards are named, “Artboard 1, Artboard 2, etc.” Let’s change that.
- Click on `Artboard 1` title and enter `icon-arrow-right`.
- Highlight the text `icon-arrow-` and hit `⌘ C` to copy the text to your clipboard.
- Now click on `Artboard 2` and hit `⌘ V` to paste `icon-arrow-` into the artboard name. Add the text `left` to make the full artboard name `icon-arrow-left`.
- Repeat steps for the next two arrows.
- Recommended names for the rest of the icons:
  - `icon-profile`
  - `icon-email`
  - `icon-settings`
  - `icon-calendar`
  - `icon-lock`
  - `icon-share`
  - `icon-edit`
  - `icon-link`
- Once all of the artboards are renamed, click the Folder Icon under the `Export to:` section.
- Navigate to your `MAX Icons` folder on the Desktop and hit `⌘ Shift N` to create a new folder. Name it `export`. 
- Hit `⌘ Shift N` to create a subfolder called `svg` and hit `Choose`.
- Now hit `Export Artboard` to export SVGs of all of your icons.

Now, let’s say you need these exported as PNGs for an iPhone app you’re working on…  
- Go back to your `Flattened` Illustrator file and hit `⌘ Option + E’ again.
- Click the Folder Icon under the `Export to:` section again.
- Navigate back to your `Export` folder and create a new folder called `png` and hit `Choose`.
- In the Export for Screens menu, select `iOS` to the right of `Formats:`.
- Hit the `X` beside the SVG line item. We don’t want SVGs in our `png` folder.
- Select `Export Artboard` to export the 3 different sizes of PNGs to your export folder.

### Review
All right, that does it. We’ve created a simple icon set using a variety of techniques with simple rectangles, ellipses, and line segments.

Remember to consider why you’re designing the icons and use that information to determine your starting grid size. In our case we used a 24px grid, but there are times when 16px, 32px, or 48px etc. might be better.

# 11 Steps to Make Your Responsive Web Design Project Succeed

![devices](/content/images/2015/04/devices.jpg)

After writing a ton of content in preparation for my [presentation at Squares conference](/real), I ended up scrapping lots of it to keep my time below an hour and a half. Now that I've had some time to go back through and make some edits, I now present to you, the scraps.

---

**Making responsive websites is hard.** Throw a bunch of opinionated people in the mix and it can seem nearly impossible. Let’s dig into what it takes to handle the pixels and the people really well. From beginning to end, we’ll walk through a solid, designer-focused process to make your next project a success.

These steps (the result of much thought and experience) are not meant to be exhaustive coverage on the much written about subject of *Responsive Web Design*, but rather suggestive in nature to inspire you to plan your work accordingly.

Though written through the lens of responsive design, the motivation behind these steps can be applied in some capacity to nearly all digital design endeavors that involve a designer and a stakeholder.

---

Here are the steps.

1. The Pitch
2. The Sale
3. The Kickoff
4. The Goals
5. The Team
6. The Deadlines
7. The Discovery
8. The Content
9. The Design
10. The Development
11. The Deliverable

---

## 1. The Pitch
The pitch is fertile ground– fresh tilled soil if you will. You have the power to decide what type of work you want to do, how you want to do it, and who you want to do it with. Put on your game face and get prepared. Don’t wander into a meeting with stakeholders without being ready to handle virtually every question that could come up.

>What’s your process? What should we do? What is your rate? How much will X cost? How long will X take?

Preparation is your upper hand. Use it wisely. 

## 2. The Sale
The sale goes hand in hand with the pitch. If you weren’t prepared during your pitch, whether you sought out a client or they found you, you’ll be forced to conform to their process or lack thereof. If you don’t have a process or a plan, the client will set priorities instead of you. I’m not saying that clients shouldn’t set priorities, but rather their priorities should be tucked properly into your specifically and thoughtfully designed process.

## 3. The Kickoff
The contract is signed, you’ve got your deposit and everyone’s excited. This is you’re chance to officially reinforce what you’ve pitched and sold in addition to the flow of the project. Here you should cover the client’s business objectives and goals (eg. “We want to capture email leads for our current and future products.”), as well as the plan to accomplish those goals. You should cover the team involved and who will be responsible for what. Deadlines, Content, Design, Development, and Deliverables should all be covered here. Explain your process, in what way you’ll present your work, and how the client should give feedback, and at what time. Cover how you’ll incorporate feedback and at which points in the project will it be too late to give certain feedback (*eg. Major design changes during launch is too late*.)

## 4. The Goals
The goals of the project, drive the project. But even deeper than that, you need to excavate the *why* behind the goals. Sometimes the *why* is clear: “We want to sell our thing to make money.”

Other times it’s foggy: “We want to collect emails.” Lots of assumptions can be made about *collecting emails* but the idea behind goal setting is getting everyone on the same page about what will make the project a success. The less abstract the better. You need details. Lots and lots of details. If the client has already prescribed a solution to their problem, you need to interrogate the solution mercilessly. Poke holes in it. Challenge it. You need to make sure you’re solving the root issue and not just a side effect of a root issue.

## 5. The Team
Once at MailChimp headquarters, I sat in on a presentation by [Michael Lopp](http://randsinrepose.com), who worked at Apple for over 8 years. He talked about how Apple had *DFRs* (Directly Responsible For) on each team. These DFRs were directly responsible for a specific area of a project. If Steve Jobs thought, “Why are these animations screwed up on iOS?” He could go immediately to the DFR over animation.

Can you feel the weight of that?

**In an Apple meeting somewhere:**

>Hey you!. Yes, you. **You** are **directly responsible** for all animations in iOS.*

If that’s you and the animations are laggy and janky in iOS, well, it’s your fault. You are to blame. If you’re a DFR and something’s not right, you’re on the hook.

We need DFRs on our projects too. It may feel slightly uncomfortable at first to link your name and everyone else’s name with a specific item, but that’s what needs to be done. Extreme accountability.

Who’s doing what. We need specifics here too. From your side and the client’s side. You need to know who will be your main contact. Are they answering to others or do they have final authority to approve decisions? If they have a boss who will make final decisions, you need to know that too. Ideally, you could have access to that boss, and involve that person in the conversations surrounding the details of the project.

Who’s in charge of the content? Who has final say over the button labels? Own it. There’s an old saying that goes “Measure twice. Cut once.”

## 6. The Deadlines
Again. Get specific. No vague answers like “early 2015” or sometime in the next few weeks. Nail it down. Set a date. Make it real. This puts the necessary pressure on everyone involved to get their stuff done on time. This is especially crucial when dependencies exist between team members. For example, “We can’t launch the website until the copy is final.” Great, who’s in charge of the copy? When will they have it done? Is anyone going to review it? Who? When? Make sure there are deadlines for the work that needs to be done.

There are some common responsive web design project deadlines, including but not limited to:

**Client**
- Written content for each section
- Written feedback on key design items
- Any business or operational task (retrieving API keys, credentials, etc.)
- Etc.

**Consulting Company (You!)**
- Initial wireframe review (if you’re even doing wireframes)
- Initial UI maps or visual exploration (style tiles, element collage, etc.)
- Initial development build. This can be rough, it’s *ok* if it doesn’t match initial visual designs just yet, the client needs to start seeing things in a browser, because that’s when it becomes real.
- Content reviews (if you’re helping with the content)
- Subsequent reviews of the previously listed items
- Etc.

Set deadlines for everything, not just the pie in the sky launch date. Oh and while I’m at it, when has anyone ever launched anything in one day. We need to start thinking of *launch week* or *launch month* instead. I’ve never launched one thing that I didn’t immediately need to tweak once it was live, which is another big reason to get the site into the browser as soon as possible.

Equally important, make sure everyone knows about and agrees to the deadlines. It’s easy to vaguely set deadlines and assume everyone will follow them, but it’s more difficult upfront to explicitly express and gather unanimous sign off on each deadline. This one act alone can work wonders for the flow of the project. No client colleague can swoop and poop on the designs right before the project goes live and demand changes if the person directly responsible for the sign off has indeed signed off.

## 7. The Discovery
We’re pirates on a treasure hunt here and should have a nice map to use based on the previous steps. During this block of time dedicated to research and discovery, we’ll familiarize ourselves with the material. This is when we need to transform ourselves into a Sponge Bob and soak as much information as possible.

Are we working on a redesign or starting from scratch? There should be a lot of back and forth with you and the client during this time. Ask, ask, ask, ask, ask. Don’t assume too much during this period. Clarify objectives for the site. Find other sites or applications that do similar things and study them. Soak up as much information as possible, including but not limited to:

- Define what you’re trying to do here and ask the most important question– *why* are we trying to do it? Don’t settle for an answer like, “We’re trying to make a responsive website, because the client is paying me to.” Challenge yourself and the client to uncover the core essence of the digital exercise. Are you selling something? Do you want to collect email addresses? Do you want people to use your app?

- Study competitors.
- Ask lots of questions.
- Study the sites that the client has told you she likes. Ask why she likes them. Determine if the examples are relevant or not, discuss with your client.
- Ask lots of questions.
- Pull inspiration from other places– colors, UI patterns, color schemes, screenshots of sites and apps.
- Comb through existing content provided by the client.
- Clearly define a desired course of action for a would-be user on the new site.
- Ask lots of questions.
- As the designer, you are the human advocate– a liaison for the users. Put yourself in their shoes to understand their wants, their needs, and their desires so you don’t have a one-sided view of the project as a whole.
- Talk to existing users that fit your project’s target market. Conduct research no matter how informal. 


## 8. The Content
Examine closely what exists and what doesn’t and see how it all fits together. Perhaps you’re redesigning an e-commerce site, so you examine the retailer’s product line-up, the categorization of goods, the hierarchy, and start plotting these things like pieces of a puzzle. Are there duplicated batches of information? Could their be a clearer presentation format? Does the content seem confusing as it exists or could items be moved around to be made more simple.

Some people like to use sticky notes and have everything up on a wall, which works great for group sessions, but if you’re like me you may want to make a good old fashioned ordered list in a word document. You can do this by examining existing content, by working with the client to determine future content, or in some cases a combination of both.

The Content is the most important piece of our digital puzzle. The proverbial meat to the bones. You can think of the content like a human’s muscles. If the content is strong and well defined, the appeal to users will be as well. If the content is weak and lacking, it won’t be able to perform well and won’t be able to command much attention.

When I first got started in web design, I put very little thought into the content. My designs were art and I was serving myself. Overtime I realized that my designs are merely an empty vessel to serve up knowledge and information to the Almighty User. Yes they’ll have a certain flavor, but the designs are ultimately a tool for serving (and persuading).

An experience will fall flat when the content is an afterthought. Early on in the kickoff as well as during research and discovery phase, talk about the content with your client. Devise a game plan for who’s directly responsible for the content and how it will be implemented.

## 9. The Design
I typically divide a project’s design phase into two sections, depending on the scope and team dynamic:

1. (UX) User Experience *or (IA) Information Architecture*
2. (UI) User Interface

These two sections are unique and individualistic, yet dependent and intertwined around each other. But alone they can’t do much without considering the content and the code. All of these pieces work together in concert much like a human body in the real world.

In Frank Chimero’s article, *The Web’s Grain*, he eloquently states:

> “Everything is so interconnected that nobody has a clear domain of work any longer— the walls are gone, so we’re left to learn how to collaborate in the spaces where things connect.”

Interconnectedness is the name of the game. We can no longer treat design, development, etc. as completely separate things. They’re all dependent on each other. Consider the human body, how the skeleton provides a framework and structure for the muscles to wrap around. The skin, hair, eyes, etc. provides the visual layer for all that lies beneath. And the organs (brain, heart, lungs, etc.) brings everything to life. It’s all interconnected and dependent. Likewise with our websites.  


**The UX, Our Skeletal Architecture**

If the skeleton provides structure for our bodies, so does the IA for our websites. If something is broken, it’s painful. If we can sign up for a newsletter but can’t ever seem to unsubscribe, that’s broken. If we try to order some food from a local restaurant’s website and keep getting a PDF, that’s broken. 

Structure is important for our bodies and our websites. The smallest fracture can cause unbearable pain. In contrast, a healthy skeletal system is appropriately crafted to provide a solid structure for the rest of the body to balance. The muscles, organs, and everything in between are tucked within the skeleton. Similarly our content, visual designs, and even lines of code are nestled into place in accordance with the site’s IA. Sorting out the structure of your site in some form or fashion is incredibly important.


**The Muscular Content**

The content serves as the muscular structure for your project. If the content is strong and well-defined your project will have plenty of substance to maintain active visitors, who can ultimately be persuaded to take action based on a set of business objectives. Think of Apple. Visit their site to check out the MacBook Pros and every detail is covered about the capabilities, the manufacturing process, the thought that went into the design, not to mention the software that comes pre-installed. You could spend hours combing through all of the content. It’s well-defined, sculpted, and attractive, not unlike the physique of a professional athlete with his or her fit body capable of great feats of strength and skill. 

On the other hand, it would be easy for Apple to completely bombard their website users with a barrage of information overload, but they elegantly layer the information in a well-structured format– served appropriately in bite-sized chunks. The content is properly placed and well-rounded, not like the guy at the gym who only does curls and has freakishly large biceps that overshadow the rest of his body.


**The UI, Our Visual Interface**

When we meet another person for the first time, we literally *interface* with that person. Interface is defined as “a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc., meet and interact.” When we shake hands with someone, we feel the strength of their grip, look into their eyes, notice details about their face, hair and skin. We make judgements instantaneously. We decide quickly how we feel about that person. Was our interaction fluid? Awkward? Fun? Average? Was the person impressive? Did they seem prideful and arrogant or meek and humble? Were they genuinely interested in you or were they only self-seeking?

We can ask the same questions about an interface design. The interface *is* the single point of contact between humans and machines, but the interface itself is not a self-contained object. It’s deeply connected to the content and the structure of the site. Like skin grafted to muscle, wrapping around bones, the interface is the presentation layer for all of the thought, effort, and work that was poured out into the creation of the system as a whole.

It’s impossible to design an effective interface without the context of the structure and the content. If these core pieces are missing, we’re in trouble. A frail skeleton with little muscle to hold up skin lacks sufficient content. It’s fragile and weak. Too much undefined content and we have bloat– a fluffy layer of insulation camouflaging the actual system of strength.

A strong skeleton with healthy muscles, healthy skin, well-kept and well-groomed, is ideal for the human body, and ideal for a website. Good structure, good content, and visually appealing features all working together harmoniously.


**The Coded Organs**

This makes everything tick. The brain, the heart, the lungs. Organs give life to our bodies and empower the necessary functions for survival, both voluntary and involuntary. To be as efficient as possible, our code powers the predetermined structure, content, and interface. Any lines of code written that do not directly affect the website are fluff– extraneous bits of data that simply create longer load times and rack up technical debt. Just like the structure, content, and appearance, the code should be succinct and necessary.

When designing, you need to have a strong opinion about each detail of your layout while respecting the constraints of front end development. Can your designs be easily reproduced in HTML/CSS or is there some heavy customization involved. Customization isn’t inherently bad, but you need to make sure that you’ve calculated that decision with the developer and you both agree that it’s necessary and not a poorly thought out design that relies on customization to cover the mistakes.

## 10. The Development
The majority of thoughts and articles on responsive design seem to focus primarily on this main area–development. Perhaps rightly so since this is, you know, what makes the actual thing work. But too much jargon and deep focus without a clear vision of the larger picture can alienate people who just aren’t there yet with their skills and understanding. So for this post’s sake, I’m covering this section from a strategic point of view, not a tactical one.

I am a designer. I identify myself as a designer even though I *can* write HTML/CSS, *enjoy* writing SASS, and (if the need arises) hack my way around in JavaScript. Heck, the first language I ever learned was Actionscript 2.0, back in the Flash era. But still, I’m a designer. It’s what I’m best at so I shy away from being directly responsible for the code base of an entire client project. 

With all that being said, it’s really important to start the development of a website as early as possible in the process. Actually writing code. If you’re a “web designer” that doesn’t know how to code (or at the very least the principles of how HTML and CSS work), you **need** to be in conversation with the developer on the project as early and as often as you can during the design process. The developer can build an early core structure and help you make decisions that will improve the overall quality of the site.

Showing clients a coded version of their site in-progress, even if it’s blocky and un-styled will produce results above and beyond what static comps can do by themselves. As long as you’ve properly outlined your process during the kickoff and the client has a clear understanding of how design and development converge to form the final product.

## 11. The Deliverable
In the end you should be delivering a website, not a set of static comps. I’m guilty of this many times over and nearly every time it’s happened I’ve cringed when seeing the final product that was handed off by me and developed by some stranger. These are the projects where I only want to put my preciously designed comps in my portfolio without a link to the final coded bastardization of my beautiful art. I’m exaggerating, but it’s my own fault if this happens.

Seeing a project through to the end is hard work, and by the time the coded designs are up and running, you’re probably sick of looking at it all, only noticing the mistakes. But it’s crucial that you as the designer are involved in the deployment of the site, **if** (and it’s a big if) you care enough about the project to get your hands dirty in the eleventh hour. I hope you do. We’re all counting on you to make something great– so is your client.

In nearly every project I’ve been involved in, the seemingly best results are in the final 10% of CSS tweaks. The details. The polish. The painful back and forth of tweak after tweak, which at the time may seem trivial, but in the end provides a cleaner and more holistic experience for the end user, who may not notice the subtle details directly, but they *will* notice a site and a design that feels “clean” and fits together nicely. They may not know why and that’s precisely the point. *You’ve* done the hard work of pushing, finessing, crafting, and tweaking the final product, so the burden of connecting the dots and sorting information isn’t on the user. You’ve relieved them from that arduous task. You’ve designed a website.

## Closing Thoughts
Every layer of separation between the design, development, content creation, and decision making, adds an unknown variable to the web design process. The more separation, the more variables. The more variables, the more time and effort each task will take.

Everyone’s brain works differently, so not all concepts will be understood the same way. A developer will tend to think of concepts in terms of how everything relates to the data under the hood, and what is and isn’t technically possible. A designer will tend to think of concepts in terms of the interface.

Everything is connected so make sure you spend lots of time in the gaps where things overlap. Take the process outlined above and make it your own. Your project will be different and may not need certain steps, but you can move forward with confidence and boldness having a plan of attack. Go forth and make websites!

# Digging the New Spotify Navigation

Spotify just updated [their navigation](http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/3/11580182/spotify-design-change-says-so-much-about-the-hamburger-button) from the hamburger menu to the good 'ole trusty-5-item-tab bar Apple has recommended in their [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Bars.html) from Day 1.

I've been guilty of over–zealously designing with the hamburger menu too—and still think it has its [occasional place](http://mds.is/hamburger/)—but I gladly welcome this Spotify update.

Now, I hope they fix the `Your Library` tracking issues. Ouch.

# A New Thing

This past January, something interesting happened. I impulsively decided to sell a [tiny product](http://mattdsmith.com/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/), moments before I *almost* decided to give it away for free. The product is simple. It's basically a stripped down version of a client project, that shows my process behind organizing wireframes using Illustrator and InDesign. It's a few `.ai` files and an `.indd` file all packaged up nicely.

[![ui kit](http://mattdsmith.com/content/images/2014/Jan/wireframing_with_illustrator-2.jpg)](http://mattdsmith.com/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/)

I didn't particularly think that this was a novel idea, but nearly everyone whom I mentioned my technique to was intrigued. I decided to write about my process for organizing a presenting wireframes and to my surprise, it gained a lot of traction. 

![january stats from gosquared](/content/images/2014/May/january_stats.png)

You can see in the image above that there was quite a jump in traffic on my site and people started buying that little product that I was *just* about to give away for free. 

To this day, May 26 2014, there have been **272** sales for a total of **$731.17.** I charged $2 (or greater thanks to a [cool gumroad feature](http://mds.io/Vjtn)) and there were quite a few folks who valued the product higher and paid $5, $10, and even $15 for this little kit.

![gumroad snapshot](/content/images/2014/May/gumroad_stats.png)

When I published the product, I knew it was worth way more than $2, but after pondering a price for a few minutes, I settle on $2 because it just felt like a good starting point for something like this.

The product is the sum of many hours (years) of experience, design, thinking, and technical layout all balled into one. To recreate the same template from scratch would easily take a day or two (possibly more) if you didn't have a good starting point or vision of what you wanted.

An average rate of *$100/hr* multiplied by 1-2 days equals *$800-$1,600*. Even at a rate of *$50/hr*, you'd spend *$400-$800* of potential billable hours designing it for yourself, even if you were fully capable of doing the work. This is why people paid more for the product. They understood the time it saved them and the value it provided.

## Even More Traffic
Another blog post I wrote, "[Understanding Vector Shapes in Illustrator](http://mattdsmith.com/understanding-vector-shapes-in-illustrator/)," got a huge traffic hit very quickly after I published it. 

I wrote the article to teach some of the basics of Illustrator, since I believe it's an under-utilized tool for wireframing and ui design. In fact, I've come across many talented designers and developers who know very little about the mysterious inner-workings of the vector editing beast that is Adobe Illustrator.

I consider myself extremely proficient in Photoshop, but I can get some serious speed going in Adobe Illustrator, allowing me to focus my thoughts on the designs much more so than the software itself. It feels natural to share the process that makes me extremely efficient.

![understanding vector shapes stats](/content/images/2014/May/april_stats.png)

After traffic picked up again, it got me thinking seriously about the potential to release more Illustrator blog posts, tutorials, kits, and more. So that's what I'm going to do.

## What Now?
Now that I know that people respond well to my posts about Illustrator, as proved by my traffic reports, I'm going to start digging in deeper.

Expect more detailed posts from me on using Illustrator from a technical standpoint as well as the *why* behind design decisions for various applications.

So for my *new thing*, I just bit the bullet and ordered $300 worth of [audio recording equipment](/buying-audio-equipment) to start creating high quality Illustrator tutorial videos. I'm planning to package and release products on a much larger scale comprised of wireframe kits as well as *how to* videos of the techniques and thinking behind the designs.

# Doing the Hard Things First

Yesterday [I wrote some updates](/back-from-the-beach) regarding [AIUX](/aiux) and the video course I’m creating. There’s a lot of things to do with the project and lots of things I *could* work on, but I’m trying to focus on the doing the hardest thing first. And that’s simply creating the videos for the course.

I’ve written a big outline of each module and each subsection, rough draft scripts for a few of the videos. I’ve written “*what you can expect to learn*” content for each video, and quite honestly I could keep going at this pace, planning and strategizing, for the rest of the year. **Doing that would not help me finish the course.**

Planning is great and all, but eventually you’ve got to stop planning and start doing. It’s odd how this is so difficult to do on a personal project, yet crucial to the potential success.

Yesterday I recorded the first three videos out of the 36+ that will eventually compile the course. If I keep my head down and keep plowing through, I can have the backbone of the course put together within two to three weeks. From there I’ll need to do lots of editing, additional filming, title design, etc. But the hard part will be done. Then I can move onto the more enjoyable things.

Doing the hard stuff first is hard, but totally necessary. This is what I’m trying to remind myself.

# Enough

My wife is reading a book, as usual, and when she comes across something interesting, she reads it to me. I like it when she does this.

The [*Notes From a Blue Bike*](http://theartofsimple.net/may-we-all-be-mexican-fishermen/) author references a classic fable about a Mexican fisherman and a tourist. It goes something like this.

>An American tourist was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.

>Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The tourist complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.

>The Mexican replied, "Only a little while."

>The tourist then asked, "Why didn't you stay out longer and catch more fish?"

>The Mexican said, "With this I have more than enough to support my family's needs."

>The tourist then asked, "But what do you do with the rest of your time?"

>The Mexican fisherman said, "I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life."

>The tourist scoffed, " I can help you. You should spend more time fishing; and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat: With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor; eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You could leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you could run your ever-expanding enterprise."

>The Mexican fisherman asked, "But, how long will this all take?"

>The tourist replied, "15 to 20 years."

>"But what then?" asked the Mexican.

>The tourist laughed and said, "That's the best part. When the time is right you would sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions."

>"Millions?...Then what?"

>The American said, "Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos."

I love simple stories like this that remind me to enjoy the simple things of every day, to enjoy the provision I currently possess, and above all to be content.

Stories like this don't thwart my drive to accomplish great things, but it does provide a nice counter balance to the ever increasing hustle of *work* and the culture of more more more.


=== FILE: fear-and-doubt.md ===
------------------------------
# Fear and Doubt

At one of my first jobs out of college, I worked at a very unique place where my employer was building a mono fin that strapped to your feet so you could swim like a dolphin. It was a pretty incredible manufacturing feat comprised of carbon fiber, CNC machined aluminum, and molded silicone rubber all working in concert to produce some serious underwater torque - enough to breach a human nearly completely out of the water.

Somehow the History Channel's show, *Modern Marvels*, caught wind and came out to the shop to film a segment on the underwater device. We were currently in the prototype stage and it wasn't 100% functional at the time.

My friend Nico, was swimming with it in the pool out back while the two man camera crew were trying to capture some footage of an actual swimmer using the thing. Nico would come out of the water telling me, and the crew, that the footplate was slipping, etc. and that it was difficult to get a proper stride going.

I knew that *Modern Marvels* wouldn't be coming back out to film if they didn't get what they needed during this trip, so I interrupted Nico, smiling and saying "Make it work!" "Just swim with it and make it work! They need the footage so make it work!" Nico glanced at me and sensed my motivation. With a quick smirk, he plunged back underwater and started swimming. 

Ultimately they got the needed footage and the segment [made it onto the show](http://vimeo.com/3508250). *Notice my sweet 15 seconds of fame at 1:50*

My blogging streak was broken last week after a mere 3 days of consistent publishing. At first I felt justified since I left town for a [funeral](http://mattdsmith.com/cancer), but soon the feelings of failure crept in. If you're anything like me, you set out to do something, anything, and if you mess up a tiny portion of that thing, it feels like the whole endeavor is ruined. I had told myself that this wasn't going to work. I wouldn't be able to do it. All because of a minor setback like the footplate slipping on the mono fin during a camera shoot.

"I'm not good enough to do that. Maybe *they* can do that, but I can't because..." These are crippling thoughts and unless you cast them out quickly they'll cause the greatest of plans to shrivel up and die.

Here's a great quote from one of my favorite books, *[As a Man Thinketh](http://thinketh.co)*:

>"Having conceived of his purpose, a man should mentally mark out a straight pathway to its achievement, looking neither to the right nor the left. **Doubts and fears should be rigorously excluded; they are disintegrating elements, which break up the straight line of effort, rendering it crooked, ineffectual, useless.** Thoughts of doubt and fear never accomplished anything, and never can. They always lead to failure. Purpose, energy, power to do, and all strong thoughts cease when doubt and fear creep in."

Doubts and fears should be rigorously excluded. They are disintegrating elements. They break the straight line of effort. They accomplish nothing. Knowing this, why would anyone succumb to such a paralyzing state of mind. Because it's the easy way out.

It's easier to say, "Oh well I can't do that because [insert any statement here]." It takes virtually no effort whatsoever to be pessimistic and generate reasons why something can't work - why you can't wake up early, why you can't get that thing finished, why you can't start exercising, why you don't have time.

>“Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right.” 
― Henry Ford

Your mind has such incredible power over your actions, it's ridiculous. Over the weekend I was telling myself that I couldn't blog for 30 days straight - that I just wouldn't be able to make it work. To this I say, "poppycock." I will continue on and slay my fear and doubt.

The rest of the section in the book I mentioned early goes on to say:

>The will to do springs from the knowledge that we can do. Doubt and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, and he who encourages them, who does not slay them, thwarts himself at every step.

>He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure. His every thought is allied with power, and all difficulties are bravely met and wisely overcome. His purposes are seasonably planted, and they bloom and bring forth fruit, which does not fall prematurely to the ground.

>Thought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force: he who knows this is ready to become something higher and stronger than a mere bundle of wavering thoughts and fluctuating sensations; he who does this has become the conscious and intelligent wielder of his mental powers.

What have lies have you told yourself that are keeping you from doing the thing that you really want to do? What's to stop you from getting started today? 


 



=== FILE: finding-time.md ===
------------------------------
# Where do you find the time?

I was asked this question last week after launching my new site. The truth is, time is there hidden in plain sight. **You just have to use it.**

There are 24 hours in a day. Everyday. It never changes. The time is there. What changes are the activities we fill our time with—the minutiae of the daily grind.

I once heard the phrase...

>“You’ve got just as many hours in a day as Beyoncé does.”

Ok, yes technically that is correct, but what does that have to do with me?

After the silliness of being compared to Beyoncé wore off, I pondered the thought more deeply and it’s something that has stuck with me.

It's true. **You**, reading this right now, have just as many hours in a day as Beyoncé. You can [make an excuse or make a way](/making-a-way).

So with that, I believe there are 3 things you must do to *find time.*

1. Stop complaining that you don’t have time
2. Prioritize and execute
3. Repeat

###### Number one—Stop Complaining
Listen, I get it. I have four kids and I wake three of them up every weekday at 6:30 AM to get them ready for school, with the help of my magnificent wife of course. 

It’s easy for me to feel justified and complain that I don’t have time to workout, to write, to work on personal projects, etc.

I do, for all intents and purposes, have a tight schedule.

I get up, get the kids ready, take them to school, go to work, come home, play with the kids, have dinner with as a family, put the kids to bed, hang out with my wife, go to sleep.

90% of the time that is my **exact** schedule.

What’s not mentioned in that list are the extra things I really want to accomplish that require more effort. Most of them have to be worked into the cracks, but none of them would ever get touched if I only complained about how my schedule was so tight.

>“Oh, but they get so much done because they don’t have kids.”

>“Oh, if I could just…”

>“Oh, if only…”

**No.**

That type of thinking has to stop if you want to make any progress whatsoever.

Ok, you've stopped complaining, now what?

###### Number Two—Prioritize and Execute
I've been a long time fan of ordered lists, but this is a fitting term I recently picked up from [Jocko Willink](http://twitter.com/jockowillink), a former Navy Seal.

**Prioritize**. What is the highest priority item in your to-do list? Aside from your daily grind, all of the things you have to do. What is most important? What will have the biggest impact if you accomplish that? Once you’ve decided what that is, you can execute. Do it. It’s that simple.

One thing I will note. My wife and kids are the most important thing in my life. I will not prioritize anything above them, long term. Occasionally things get in the way and I have to steal and hour or two here and there from my family to squeeze in a workout or finish something with work, but I try very hard not to make that a habit. Likewise, I encourage you to draw a line in the sand for yourself on things that matter the most to you.

Prioritizing can be tricky though. For example, in this very moment I need to finish writing this post AND I really want to go for a run before my meeting at 8:30.

>Side note: At the time of this writing I’m in  Houston this week for a client workshop—so no normal schedule for me.

It took me a while to decide whether I should write first or run first. It might seem like a silly decision to make, “Matt, just freaking pick one and do it.” Exactly. Stop wasting time worrying about what to do first and just freaking start doing it. Ultimately I decided I wanted to write this before I ran, so there you go.

**Execute.** Once you determine the priority you plow through your list one at a time until things are done. If tasks are to big, then you break them down into bite-sized pieces.

I realize there are more complex situations with work and personal aspirations that require more planning and more thought, but the simpler you can make the scenarios the better.

I’ve got lots of plans for personal projects that I’m actively thinking about and/or working on. To name a few: re-release public AIUX enrollment, work on my Adobe MAX presentations, start working on some new courses, finish writing my freelancing book, continue development on my course software, publish an article every Monday. 

Just typing that out makes me anxious and that list doesn’t even include the client work I’m doing day to day to pay the bills.

So in the case for my website last week, I just decided that I wanted to finish it. I put it as the number one priority in my side project category. I put all of that other stuff on hold for a few days and blistered through it with as much focus and intensity as I could. It’s not perfect, but it’s done enough where I can comfortably move on to the next thing.

The next thing… I’m still trying to decide on that and I can assure you, I will make no progress until I make one of them THE priority and execute as furiously as I can.

###### Number Three—Repeat
Now you have to do it again.

# How the Float Label Pattern Started

I first had the idea for a new input pattern back in [August, 2013](http://dribbble.com/shots/1202290-Craigslist-New-Post-Animated?). The idea was simple enough - animate placeholder text to show an icon beside the input so you don't lose your context.

I had been doing 99% mobile work for the past 2 years and little things like this can really add up. I wanted a solution that saved space, looked clean and clear, but didn't forego usability.

-->

Even a simple username and password scenario can be frustating with no labels. I can never quite remember if it says "username" or "username or email" in the first field. And that's a big deal when logging in. It's frustrating to not know if something is right or not because there's no label. I still thought the orginal concept had merit, but quickly realized that an icon alone is not enough to be fully accessible.

After scrapping the icon idea I thought:

>"There needs to be a way to make this simple enough to use out of the box without needing to come up with, and design an icon set for every use of this form." 

That's when I designed [a new version](http://floatlabel.com) using text only, plus a slight animation for the float label. I spent a long time thinking about the micro-interactions of when the active color would change and how soon would the text animate after someone typed. These were tiny decisions made down to the very last keyframe in my 30 FPS file.

![float label pattern](http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6410/screenshots/1254439/form-animation-_gif_.gif)

In my mind it was a small idea towards making my app that much easier to use. 

_(Aside: This was designed for a post-only Craigslist app I was tinkering with.)_

**I had no idea** it would be so well received. To my surprise it made it to the #1 spot on Dribbble's popular page for the day. That definitely helped get some early traction.

A few days later a long time Twitter friend, [Jared Verdi](http://twitter.com/jverdi), busted out the first real implementation in Obj-C. Super cool.

Somehow Jared's github post blew up a bit and everyone seemed to be tweeting about it. Thankfully he named it something cool when he first implemented it because I never did - _[JVFloatLabeledTextField](https://github.com/jverdi/JVFloatLabeledTextField)_. The "float label pattern" was born.

Jared deserves oodles of credit for breathing life into the idea, which otherwise may have fizzled out in the corner of the internet like a sad and lonely mediocre cat gif.

Remember that crazy, dancing guy video called _First Follower_ posted by [Derek Sivers](http://twitter.com/sivers)?

As expected, there are [a](https://twitter.com/cjforms/status/393480697790218240) [few](https://twitter.com/mattlangan/status/393393473073606656) [naysayers](https://twitter.com/codepo8/status/393411120771260416) to put some healthy tension on the subject, but ultimately this is worth exploring. Especially on small mobile forms.

Thanks to all who've contributed to the idea so far. 🙏

# Four

![four](/content/images/2014/May/four.jpg)

My fourth child, [Nixon](http://mattdsmith.com/nixon), was born a week ago and now I have four kids. Four. I can't believe that is a true statement, but it is. Four kids, wow.

Having four kids is hard. The other day my wife was holding our new baby while our 2 middle kids were melting down at the dinner table and screaming (due to no naps) and my oldest was asking the same question repeatedly over and over and over and over. My wife and I were completely out of control of our children and in that moment we both began to panic laugh to each other thinking, "Oh my God, what have we gotten ourselves into."

We eventually *came to* and got things under control, but wow, things escalate quickly. Things can really get out of hand.

Jim Gaffigan said it best:

>"People ask me, "Oh, what's it like having four kids?" and I tell them. Imagine you're drowning... 



>...and then someone hands you a baby.

At this stage of life there seems to be emotional pockets of feeling trapped and overcommitted, but then in an instant that feeling is replaced by deep joy and gratitude.

I'm realizing more and more the importance of savoring *the moment.* The moments when I look at my kids calmly playing together and think about how sweet they are. The moments when my wife and I can talk and laugh together and with the kids. 

Those savory moments are found in the midst of frustration and difficulty, but I've found that you will find what you are looking for. Whether it's pain or pleasure, beauty or flaw, suffering or joy, you will find it. What you believe and set your mind on, will manifest for you.

Here's a quote from one of my favorite books that sums it up more eloquently.

>The soul attracts that which it secretly harbours; that which it loves, and also that which it fears; it reaches the height of its cherished aspirations; it falls to the level of its unchastened desires, and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own.

>-James Allen, *[As a Man Thinketh](http://thinketh.co)*

My life is so full of love and happiness (and trials and hardships and frustrations and confusion), but through all of this, by God's grace, I still manage to find incredible joy. Joy because I'm blessed beyond measure with a beautiful and loving wife. Blessed with four kids that warm the core of my soul.

I have no idea who I would be if it weren't for my wife and kids. Most likely I would be a complete wreck with very poor nutrition and hygiene. But now, I have the constraint of marriage, the constraint of fatherhood, and the constraint of providing for my family. These constraints help set my path straight. They provide the boundaries for my life.

I remember a time when I was a young teenager, my friend was spending the night and we were outside staring at the stars, thinking about infinite space and pondering our lives. I remember saying, "Isn't it crazy that one day, we'll get married to someone and have our own children. *We* will be in charge of taking care of our kids instead of our parents providing for us."

That young teenager staring at the stars and pondering life blinked once... now he's a married man and a father of four.

# Free Adobe CC for a Year Plus Access to AIUX

--- 

<img src="/content/images/2016/09/jared.jpeg" alt="mds presenting" style="width: 26%; float: left; margin: 0 2em 1em 0;">

I'm excited to announce <a href="http://twitter.com/itstoelean">Jared Tohlen</a> is the winner of Adobe CC for a year and lifetime access to [AIUX](https://rwd.aiux.co).

Big thanks to everyone, who entered the contest. It was difficult to select a winner, but in end Jared hit the most points about why he should win.

---

Here's the comment that sealed the deal for Jared:

>Hi Matt,

>Sweet giveaway! I'm a graphic designer/illustrator. I have tons of experience and know-how in Adobe programs, especially Illustrator. What I don't have is: money and formal UX training/experience.

>I would love the opportunity to finally get some solid UX training under my belt, as it seems not having that is a huge count against me. For job applications and projects, it's probably my biggest weakness. About the money thing: I have a two-year-old daughter and am expecting another one here soon (due date is 9/15). My current Adobe CC sub expires 9/4 and I am at the stage of life where 1) I haven't been able to build up a freelance/side business for supplemental income and 2) I can't afford the extra expense a CC sub would add to a tight budget.

>These are also reasons why I'm more and more motivated and driven to finally start leveling up in my career— wanting to provide for my family as best I can, and weary of tight money. The help and relief a free CC sub would supply, and finally getting UX training to be more relevant in today's design industry would make a world of difference.

>Way to be helping others out. I know there are a lot of other folks even more in need or deserving than I, so I hope you find the right person for this. If it doesn't come to me, I know I'll find a way. Thanks for your consideration, Matt!

---

**For historical purposes, the original contest description is below...**

I'm giving away one year of free Adobe CC and unlimited access to my UX design course, [AIUX](https://rwd.aiux.co).

This coupon code will give you access to Adobe Illustrator—and all of the other Adobe apps, **free for one year**, a $599 value. *Because $49.99/month times 12 months equals $599.88.*

<style>.postcap { display:none; border-bottom: none; } .postcap.giveaway { display: block; }</style>

I specifically mention Illustrator because that’s what I teach heavily in AIUX. It's like one big digital whiteboard and I show you how to blister through it for the quickest and best results.

**But, Matt what about Sketch?** I use and love Sketch as my primary UI design tool, but if I need to work through flows and wireframes Illustrator takes the cake.

Plus as a designer, you shouldn't be worried about the ONE tool you need to learn. There will always be an arsenal at your disposal and Illustrator has been around for a looooong time and it's here to stay.

In the AIUX course, I teach a **mobile-first approach** to wireframe design specifically for responsive websites. You'll learn a beginning to end strategic and tactical UX process you can put to use immediately.

It’s perfect for those wanting to get started in UX—whether you’ve been dev-only or graphic design-only up until now.

I’ve had **over 140** students go through the course with great results. Top industry experts have also reviewed and approve the material. 💥

# The Difference Between a Good Designer and a Super Designer

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JQJJjcrwXQE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the movie *Megamind*, Megamind succinctly explains to Tighten (he misspells “Titan”) the difference between a villain and a super villain. While Tighten is very evil and villainess he just doesn’t compare to Megamind’s audacious and theatrical performances during the movie. Watch the clip above to see what I mean.

The same is true for a good designer and a super designer. A good designer will attempt to craft smart solutions to visual problems at hand, but often they will stop there, expecting a creative director or client to be won over by the visuals alone, letting the work speak for itself, and asking only “What do you think?” or respond to critiques, "I can totally make that any color." or "I can easily change that, I was just putting something there." This relies on client feedback as the driver of the design instead of the designer taking on the leadership of the project. 

I’ve done this many times. Even recently. It’s easy, and sometimes you get lazy. I get it. But remember that a design is only as good as its presentation. You have to sell it. Pitch it. What angle are you taking? What emotion are you appealing to? It needs to be tight. Have an answer for every possible question that could be brought up, but just as important, be honest if you’ve overlooked something or don’t have a concrete answer.

>Vulnerability and openness can be a solid persuasive partner to full-blown, unwavering confidence.

Consider your design-critiquing audience. Is it a creative director, a client, a peer, a colleague? Are you in collaborative mode versus a big reveal or vice versa? Take all of these nuances into account to prepare for your big presentation. 

Sometimes it helps to anticipate possible questions about your design, while you’re actually designing it. This can give your work a self-induced, objective point of view that makes it a better design. Design for those potential questions that may come up during a presentation and you’ll be on your way to becoming a super designer.

# Good Pens and Brushes for Hand Lettering

I've got a little product I'm working on that needs a logo. My typical logo style is very shape-based, geometric and mathematical. Even though I do sketch out a lot of logo ideas in my sketch book, it's generally to get an idea of a framework or system that I'll use within some type of geometric grid.

For _this_ new logo I want to try a new hand-lettered, scripty style. I don't have much experience doing this so I reached out to my friend, Neil Summerour.

![breaking](/content/images/2013/Nov/Summerour_Breaking_01.jpg)
The image above is a beautiful [hand lettered piece](http://swashandkern.com/#/breaking/) by Neil. If you haven't seen his [typefaces](http://positype.com) and [lettering projects](http://swashandkern.com), you need to go do that right now. You can also follow him - [@positype](http://twitter.com/positype) on Twitter.


**My email to him:**
> Hey Neil,

>Can you recommend some nice pens, brushes, and/or paper for sketching and hand lettering? I'd like to move beyond the quality of my sharpie and generic sketchbook. :)

>Thanks!

>Matt


**His prompt response:**

>Ha… a valid request…

>oddly, I still encourage people to keep to the rudimentary elements/materials that they are comfortable with… good lettering, personal lettering is based in comfort and familiarity… you can't force it.

>BUT… the creative likes to explore and play…

>I'd suggest starting with this…

>paper… that's personal preference more than a requirement

>I rely on the bristol, 100% cotton and high-grade tracing papers to play

There you have it. Go draw.

# Grok 2014 Pre Game

It's that time of year again and [Grok](http://theironyard.com/grok) is in the air. This is my third time attending and I was giddy the whole time during my hour and a half trek up here from Athens.

I wasn't quite able to make it to early registration since my oldest son, [Noah](http://instagram.com/p/mTjGl9jKNl/), had a baseball game that I didn't want to miss. That and my very pregnant wife will be parenting the three of our kids solo for the next 3 days and I wanted to help her out before my departure. She's an incredible woman and I'm extremely blessed to have her holding the fort down for me.

It's funny the amount of people I talked with tonight who are married with kids. There were a handful of us sitting at a table that counted 22 kids in total between our little group. The dominant conversation tonight was balancing married life with raising kids while still maintaining sanity.

It's funny how you go to a web conference, but really thrive on just being human with other humans, apart from what you do for a living. It's fun to talk shop, and that is a big part of it, but ultimately you just want to *belong* with other people who are living life, same as you, and learning things along the way.

Tonight was just the pre game. I'm stoked for what the next few days have in store.

**Update:** [This is what was in store.](http://mattdsmith.com/grok-2014-recap/)

# Grok 2014 Recap

![grok](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_03__9_07_27_AM.jpg)

My mind was (and still is) completely consumed with thoughts, ideas, the conversations, and the experiences I had at [Grok](http://theironyard.com/grok). This is usually the case after conferences, but especially so after Grok. This was my third annual attendance and, in my opinion, the best one yet. The people, the dialogue, the keynotes, the venues, and holy crap... the BMWs.

---

## Day One
Fresh off the heels of conversations from the [previous night of early registration](http://mattdsmith.com/grok-2014-pre-game), we kicked day one off by hanging out, chatting, and drinking some seriously top notch coffee from Will of [Vagabond Barista](https://twitter.com/vagabondbarista). Will was probably the happiest person at the conference. As soon as you approach his pop up coffee stand, his face lights up and he's all, "Dude! What's up!? What's your name, man?" He's genuinely thrilled that you are approaching his table for some $4 dollar coffee when there is free coffee 20 yards away. Will was one of my favorite people from Grok 2014. I also had the pleasure of riding with him as he drove the BMW M3 in the timed laps. Happiness times twenty. Oh what we all could learn from Will and his perspective on life.

#### Kristian Andersen and the Meaning of Success

![grok](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_03__10_23_57_AM.jpg)

After coffee, [Kristian Andersen](https://twitter.com/kristianindy) gave a great talk covering the three lies of success. 

1. You need to go to college
2. You need to buy a house
3. Follow your passion

Kristian wasn't completely dogmatic in his views of the first two points, but rather provided insight into why these have become the default "next steps" after high school and why it's smart to consider alternatives.

His third and best point was a lie, according to him, that he has told people for years: "Follow your passion." He dismantled the idea that there is this passionate "thing" you want to do and if you do it then everything will be rainbows and sunshine. Kristian spent some time on the meaning of passion and how its latin root literally means "suffering." He spoke of the *passion of Christ* and how the word is appropriately used in that context.

He outlined a number of brands that drew a line in the sand with their beliefs and were willing to "suffer" for what they believed, drawing examples from Southwest Airlines and their cheesy, country music-singing flight attendants to Virgin Airlines with their high value of design, relevance, and sexiness. Virgin even has designer barf bags. Kristian pointed out that these two brands know who they are, what they stand for and are willing to suffer for it. 

His talk wrapped up with a challenge to the audience: "What are you willing to *suffer* for?" As opposed to "follow your passion." This idea set a great tone for the rest of the conference. 

![group](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_03__10_43_41_AM.jpg)

#### 10/20s
These times can be hit or miss depending on the group you are with and the topics presented. There is a moderator who outlines the process of presenting a topic to the group, speaking to it for a while, and finally discussing it with the group. Overall I'm very pleased with the ideas that got kicked around. It's great to have these nook and cranny conversations during the main event.

![10/20](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_03__11_51_04_AM.jpg)

#### Mason Stewart, Ryan McCrary, and John Saddington
Next up were a few, quick-burst curated talks from three fine gentleman.

![mason](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_03__4_07_27_PM.jpg)

[Mason Stewart](http://twitter.com/masondesu), instructor at The Iron Yard's Code School, gave a great little talk on learning styles and his experience with a great teacher who gave her students room to learn in the own unique ways. 

![ryan](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_03__4_24_35_PM.jpg)

[Ryan McCrary](http://twitter.com/ryanmccrary), executive director at [Great Outdoor Adventure Trips](http://goattrips.com), told a great story about his journey to teach lower income kids about business. After a few failed attempts at traditional presentation of business concepts to these 8-15 year olds, he found success by helping them start their own screen printing t-shirt business. He challenged the audience to discover ways we could help others by our own work.

![john](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_03__4_42_09_PM.jpg)

[John Saddington](http://twitter.com/saddington), a guy who's done a lot of [cool things](http://john.do/about), took a very practical nuts and bolts walk through his process of concepting, sketching, designing, programming, and eventually selling several of his successful products. 

#### Squarespace Drink Up at Barley's
A nice social event to cap off the first day. Lots of good conversations with a variety of folks. I would attempt to list them all here, but I'm sure I'd make an accidental omission. You know who you are and I truly enjoyed it.

--- 

## Day Two
We kicked things off on day two in a similar fashion with Will's most excellent coffee and some light conversations with the group. This day was a thinner crowd than the day before since half of the crew, Group 1, made the trek up to the BMW Performance Driving School, while the other half, Group 2, stayed for 10/20s.

#### 10/20s

![table](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_03__3_17_19_PM.jpg)

The discussions on this day seemed more rich than the previous day. Perhaps everyone had gotten a bit more acclimated to the idea and format. There was quality banter on remote working, designer developer relationships, zombie apocalypse weapons and more. 

#### BMW Performance Driving School
![bmw wristband](http://distilleryimage10.ak.instagram.com/1917ea0cbc0f11e3b3ba0002c9562536_8.jpg)

Hole. Lee. Cow. This was fantastic. I knew this was going to be good, but I seriously had my mind blown. We took a conversation-packed bus trip up to Spartanburg. After arriving, we had some prep from the lead instructor and signed our lives away on a waiver. I was more than obliged to do this.

The first car I drove was the 575 Horsepower BMW M6 with the competition package, including carbon fiber and ceramic brake kits valued a $9,000. For some reference, the brakes on the M6 are worth more than my current vehicle, a 2003 Honda Element.

I was super excited yet oddly relaxed about the idea of driving these high performance cars, but after the instructor gave us the run down about paddle shifting, acceleration, braking, etc. I got a little nervous. My hands were totally shaking as I prepared to drive the $120,000 vehicle *at speed* on a race course. The M6 was crazy fast and crazy fun.

The next course I ventured to, was the timed lap track where there were four M3s taking turns doing laps to see who could get the fastest time. You could hear and smell burning rubber as each machine bolted around the track with varying levels of amateurism. This was my favorite track to drive and most people I talked to felt the same way. I could have done that over and over and over for several days in a row. So much fun.

The last track I drove was an oval slick track with sprinklers going to wet everything down. Two competitors were positioned on each side of the track and raced 3 laps to see who was declared the winner. Many cars spun out and apparently someone drove a car straight off the track into a ditch filled with water. I wish I could've seen that. This track was fun but not as much as the others.

Then there was the heat lap on a much longer road course. This was a *ride only* track where a professional race car driver blazed the asphalt at ungodly speeds. I have so much more respect for race car drivers now after seeing what one can do behind the wheel of a crazy fast M6.

There was an off-road course where you could drive the latest X5s up and down rocky terrain and through water, but I was so engulfed in the road tracks I never got around to doing it.

All in all, it seemed like everyone was on cloud nine the entire time. Perma-grins were plastered on the face of each grok crew member and we all sounded like a bunch of grade school kids talking about how awesome everything was. Fantastic event.

![bmw driving school](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_04__2_42_59_PM.jpg)

#### Sam Fogarino of Interpol

![sam](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_04__4_45_10_PM.jpg)

Sam gave an honest and raw talk about his pursuit of a music career, eventually becoming Interpol's drummer, and making records. He talked about how egos can so easily infect the collaborative process and that *respect* for one another is ultimately what is needed to be a successful group.

#### Facebook After Party
Imagine perfect weather by a river in an open air pavilion. A gentle breeze is slightly blowing and the smell of fresh cooked food lures you in. There's a bar where the alcohol flows like wine and Grokkers flock like the salmon of Capistrana. There's a guy cutting and lighting a variety of cigars for those who care to indulge. Live music is tickling your ears while you continue to go on and on about the BMW adrenaline rush from earlier that day. This was the after party. It was a solid finish to a fantastic two day event.

Afterwards a group of us hit up Trappe Door for awhile and on my walk back to the hotel, I ate half a pizza.

---

## Day Three
The crowd thinned a bit this day as some folks cut out early, but this was a great time to squeeze in some last minute conversations before everyone traveled back to their own part of the world. We were on a rooftop in downtown Greenville and once again were blessed with lovely weather.

![roof top](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_05__2_55_21_PM.jpg)

#### Hunger Crunch

![hunger crunch](/content/images/2014/Apr/Photo_Apr_05__11_14_39_AM.jpg)

[Bryan Martin](http://twitter.com/bryanrmartin) gave a status update on [Hunger Crunch](http://hungercrunch.com) and the long journey that it's taken to get where they are today with the game. His talk was truly moving and very inspiring. Bryan is a very humble guy who genuinely believes he is nothing special and definitely not super. But I can tell you that he is an incredible artist, presenter, and one all-round super dude. The fact that he thinks he is not super makes him even more super, in my opinion. Hats off to [Bryan](http://twitter.com/bryanrmartin), [Dodd](http://twitter.com/doddcaldwell), [Rob](http://twitter.com/f1fe), and team for their absolutely moving work on Hunger Crunch and their mission for [Rice Bowls](http://ricebowls.com). I have no doubt in my mind they are on to something really really big.

#### Iron Yard Code School Graduates
Mason Stewart introduced a handful of Code School graduates who worked on a final projects over the last two and a half weeks of their program. Seeing their final projects was really incredible especially considering that 99% of them had zero coding experience before they began the course. It's really cool to see the success of The Iron Yard's Code School program.

---

### Final Thoughts
If you haven't gathered this from reading the rest of the post, let me say it bluntly - Grok was amazing. This was the best year yet and if you've never been, you should absolutely make it out next year to come see for yourself that all the hype is true.

I left Grok inspired to do more and to focus on what matters. I'm determined to press in to gain more and more clarity on exactly what it is that I'm willing to suffer for.

Also, BMWs!!

# Why You Should Think Twice Before Importing a Gumroad Customer Email List Directly Into MailChimp

Now that I've gotten started on a [new thing](http://mattdsmith.com/new-thing/), I was eager to start emailing my existing Gumroad customers, who purchased my [Illustrator and InDesign Wireframing Kit](http://mattdsmith.com/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/), as well as my standard newsletter subscribers, in an attempt to spread the word.

In my zealousness, I did something that was not cool. *I exported all of my Gumroad customer email addresses and imported them into my MailChimp list without their permission.*

After doing so, I proceeded to send the email below to both my existing subscribers and my newly imported, not-really-subscribers.

>Hey,

>So I’ve recently taken the plunge and bought some solid audio equipment for a new thing. That new thing is creating in-depth tutorials for Adobe Illustrator. My main focus to begin with, is to teach you how to get super fast and familiar with Illustrator and its tools, to use for your own projects, that will in turn make you money (possibly even a living), as my projects do for me.

>I’m planning to create a very detailed series on using Illustrator for creating wireframes, specifically for a responsive e-commerce website. I’ll start with mobile designs, expand to desktop, and show you breakpoint variations in between, all while covering quick keys and tips and tricks.

>I want to provide more value for you by creating an actual thing that you can use, as opposed to showing high-level tutorials with no real world applications.

>Reply to this email and tell me your what you think about this approach. Will this help you?

>Thanks!

>--
>Matt 

After sending the above email I received quite a few unsubscribes. Rightly so. I also got a reply back from a very disgruntled recipient *(make sure you see his reply below)*, confirming my initial hesitation and doubts about my tricky export/import maneuvers.

Fortunately, this was a single instance and every other reply was extremely positive and encouraging. However, that doesn't negate the fact that I overstepped my bounds. 

So this morning, I segmented out the previously imported Gumroad customers within my MailChimp list and sent *this* email to only those people.

>Hey there,

>I'm sending you this email because you bought my "[Wireframing with Illustrator and InDesign Kit](http://mattdsmith.com/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/)" from Gumroad recently. Thanks for that! If you have any feedback at all, positive or negative, I'd love you hear from you.

>Also, I want to extend to you an apology. You see, yesterday I decided to email my "mds subscribers" MailChimp list to let everyone know about a [new thing](http://mattdsmith.com/new-thing/) I'm doing with Illustrator and some wireframing, plus future video tutorial products. Here is [the email](http://us1.campaign-archive1.com/?u=1de7d962e5924ab8365be96ca&id=116d2ff6bb) if you missed it.

>Without much consideration for my existing Gumroad customers (i.e. YOU reading this right now), I exported all of your email addresses from Gumroad and into my MailChimp list. I assumed that if you bought my wireframing kit that surely you'd like to hear more about the same topic.

>Perhaps this is true for you. I hope it is, but I also realize that some of you were probably thinking, "Why is this random guy emailing me and how did I even got on his list?"

>Many people unsubscribed yesterday, which is totally understandable. One person went above and beyond to let me know exactly what he thought about my irresponsible email importing actions.

>![happy camper he is not](/content/images/2014/May/cobra-1.png)

>Here's the deal, to avoid further confusion, right now you *are on* my email list and I'll be sending emails to this list with design tips and tricks, specifically for Illustrator and possibly others in the future. I'm also working on creating a robust and in-depth product series that will be available for purchase later this year.

>If you'd like to keep up with what's going on, do nothing (because you're already on the list) and just keep reading.

>If you'd like to *no longer receive these emails* from me, please hit *unsubscribe* below.

>Thanks so much,

>-[Matt](http://twitter.com/mds)

I thought about removing the Gumroad customers completely from my list, but lots of them had already responded, saying that they're looking forward to the new content and excited to see what's next.

Removing existing customers from the list and emailing an apology *and* telling them to rejoin if they wanted, even though some of them were already onboard and excited, *but* telling them they had been subscribed and unsubscribed, and now they could resubscribe... well, that all just seemed too complicated, so I sent one last email *(above)* to apologize and try to clarify things.

Hopefully you can learn from my mistake if you decide to enter into the realm of consumer product creation and email marketing.

## A Better Solution
A better solution to get my Gumroad customers willingly over to my MailChimp list would have been to message those customers directly about the product they purchased, through Gumroad. I could have used that as a channel to ask how the product worked out for them and answer any questions they had about using it.

Then, I could let them know I was doing something new with my email list on a similar topic and that they could subscribe if they'd like.

This method would have only converted a fraction of the existing customers to the newsletter, but that fraction would be a loyal fraction to build on. 

Would you have handled things differently? What could I have done better? Let me know in the comments below.

# Habits

When I was 13, I smoked my first cigarette. Maybe it was 14. Either way, I was young. A friend of mine, Billy, was older looking than the rest of us–tall and lanky with a protruding Adam’s apple. He had a crackly-sounding kind of voice so he wasn’t usually questioned at the register when he bought our cigs.

For the next 7 or 8 years I was a smoker. Sneaking them on the weekends with friends and eventually buying my own. About a pack a day. Smoking is a powerful habit, intertwined throughout your various daily activities. First thing in the morning, while you’re driving, when you get done with a class, after you eat, before you go to bed.

By the time I was in my early 20s, I quit cold turkey. A story I’ll save for another day, but I want to paint the picture of a habit. Some habits are good and some bad. Well my friend, I have another bad habit I'd like to talk about.

>Checking my phone.

Mostly Twitter, with the occasional Facebook and Instagram thrown in. In search of the ever-fleeting red dot dopamine rush.

I’ve heard lots of stories about social media detoxes, whether they’ve been from friends, acquaintances, or random blog posts or podcasts. The most recent was [Jason SurfrApp](http://jasondoesstuff.com) interviewed by my friend [Adam](http://twitter.com/avclark) on [The Gently Mad](http://avclark.com/tgm). I’ve considered such detoxes in the past, but the thought quickly vanished, probably after refreshing my Twitter feed for the millionth time that hour. I enjoy Twitter, but it doesn’t deserve to be my default behavior during every idle moment I have.

I was reading a book just before Christmas and I suddenly realized how little time I have during the first quarter of 2015. It’s jam packed with two big client contracts, lots of plans for [AIUX](/aiux), as well as preparing material for my workshop at [Squares Conference](http://squaresconference.com). During that moment I impulsively deleted every social app off of my phone. Tweetbot, Facebook, Instagram, Tiiny, Vine, and Twitter for iPhone (as if one Twitter app wasn’t enough). It felt refreshing yet very strange not having a source of connected-ness in my pocket.

I replaced those apps on my iPhone’s home screen with two, iBooks and iA Writer. Reading and writing are two things I really really want to do more. There are like 8 books in iBooks that I’ve bought but haven’t read. Not to mention the 2 or 3 other paper backs in my queue that have barely been touched.

With my social cigarettes now crumpled up and thrown in the trash, I still notice the urge to pull my phone out all the time. When I walk into an empty room in my house I would usually check Twitter or any other social media app of choice. When I go to the bathroom I would check Twitter or any other social media app of choice. When I pull up at red lights I would check Twitter or any other social media app of choice. And sometimes, lots of times actually, I'll check my phone while driving, which is insanity. Seriously, what the hell?

In the book, [Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU/ref=as_sl_pc_ss_til?tag=madsm-20&linkCode=w01&linkId=XIJ7OXL3DAJI5PR5&creativeASIN=B0055PGUYU), the author talks about a *neural pathway* or *rut* that appears in your brain after a habit is formed, like a dirt trail in an otherwise leafy forest. The book told a story of a man who had completely lost all memories due to an illness, but still managed to successfully take walks around his neighborhood and back to his house, even though he couldn’t remember his address, any street names or where he was actually going.

There's is no way to remove a bad habit altogether, because of the pathway that has already formed in your brain that enables the habit cycle. The *cue*, the *routine*, and the *reward*, which would go something like this:

>Matt walks into an empty room (*cue*), reaches into his pocket to pull out his phone to check Twitter (*routine*), and finally sees that he’s “caught up” or possibly "filled with knowledge" (*reward*).

This habit cycle is the exact same for every habit. The trick then, to get rid of a bad habit, is to replace the routine with something good in hopes that it produces the same type of feeling or reward as the original routine. It’s been a week for me with no Twitter, Facebook, etc. on my phone and I’ve already managed to read 3 books. It’s weird not having constant access on my phone, but it also eliminates so much distraction. I’ve still pulled up Twitter and Facebook occasionally during the week, but probably 90% less than normal. Overall, I would say that reading a book instead of checking Twitter is indeed an acceptable routine for my brain's neural pathway.

There are so many things I want to accomplish, I simply can’t afford to have my thoughts and actions derailed every time I have an idle moment. I’m not quitting social media or anything drastic because I do believe it's valuable, but I won't be using my phone for it anymore. Like anything it must be used in moderation or it becomes bad for you.

This is my new years resolution–to be less distracted and more focused.

# Hacking Ghost

My favorite code editor is [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com), but not default Sublime. Default Sublime is *OK*, but not great.

The [Spacegray](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/) theme, by [Gadzhi Kharkharov](https://twitter.com/kkga_), makes it great. I could stare at it for hours.

I have a thing for dark interfaces when they're done really well.

Because I like coding in the Spacegray–Sublime environment so much, I decided it would be cool if my Ghost backend had a similar style.

>[Ghost](https://ghost.org) is the little CMS that powers this site.

Default Ghost is pretty good, but I thought it would be nice to put more of an emphasis on the markdown editor (middle) over the navigation bar (left) and the content preview panel (right).

Here's the default ghost backend...

![default ghost](/content/images/2016/03/mds-default-ghost.png)

And here is my faux `mds-spacegray` theme...

![content](/content/images/2016/03/mds-spacegray-ghost-01.png)

![editor](/content/images/2016/03/mds-spacegray-ghost-02.png)

All I had to do was edit the CSS file in `core > built > assets > ghost.css`. I saved the original just in case something got screwed up. 

So far I've only styled the "New/Edit Post" and "Content" sections and nothing else. Since that's where I spend 95% of my time when using the Ghost CMS, that's all I really care about for now.

If you want to use this faux Spacegray Ghost Admin Theme, [download these CSS files](http://mds.io/fZKE), and upload them into your `core > built > assets > *` folder. Make sure to save your original ghost.css if you wanna go back.

# Hacking Wistia’s API to Create a Custom Play Button

![nicer play button](/content/images/2015/09/default-vs-custom.png)

Since my [AIUX](/aiux) video course app is in the final stretch of completion, a few weeks ago I signed up for a [Wistia](http://wistia.com) account and started uploading some of the course videos.

Wistia has a pretty extensive API, which is great, because I’m not the biggest fan of their play button. It's a rectangle with sharp edges and it feels a little out of place inside of my AIUX app.

Since my course *is for designers*, I’d hate for the the primary interaction—*playing videos*—have a button that’s not as fun and fitting as it could be to press. 

## The Default Wistia Player
<iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/6ifznz41l9?videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="640" height="360"></iframe><script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js"></script>

This is the default Wistia player embedded with an iframe. That rectangular play button may not bother you, but it just felt really out of place within the context of my full lessson screen design.

![lesson screen for aiux](/content/images/2015/09/aiux-lesson.png)
>*Lesson page detail from the AIUX course*

I want the experience of navigating and playing the AIUX lessons to be just as good as following along and learning from  the course videos themselves.

At first, I tried overriding the CSS styles of the button's background property, but had no luck. I think the javascript injected inline styles were blocking me. 

## Creating the Custom Button
I designed a new play button and gradient overlay from scratch in Sketch and exported the little triangle icon as an `.svg`.

![play button design in Sketch](/content/images/2015/09/play-btn-sketch.png)

I coded both of the elements on top of the Wista player iframe, then tapped into the Wistia API to hide the default play button and add the appropriate actions to mine. 

## Bringing it To Life
Check out this CodePen to see the markup for the overlay and play button as well as the Sass and Javascript. Press the play button, pause the video, and scrub the timeline to see how the custom button works with the Wistia video.

# My Son's New Hairdo

During a recent airplane trip, I looked out of my window at roughly ~30,000 feet.

The sky was clear.

I could still see houses, cars, industrial sections, and more. I could even see and handful of tiny planes flying beneath us.

I'm always blown away how much of the earth you can see at one time from an airplane.

I thought about the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of people directly beneath me that have no idea who I am, where I am, nor do they care.

It makes you feel quite small when you really let that idea soak in. And I don’t think that’s a bad thing.

For me, it's a freeing thought. 

Now, if you amplify that same feeling of smallness across thousands of cities, multiple states, multiple countries, multiple continents, quite literally billions of people, well now you’ve really made yourself really insignificant.

With that cold hard, small nugget of truth in your mind, compare that to the handful of people you follow on Twitter, or the handful of folks you’re *friends* with on Facebook.

![a bunch of grey dots and one pink dot](/content/images/2016/10/scale.svg)

See that tiny pink dot. That's my representation of **your** social circle in the midst of exponentially more people.

Think about how much fear you actively or passively deal with coming from that tiny speck.

Fear of…

- failing
- being judged
- being made fun of
- letting someone down
- not being good enough
- of doing something wrong
- not being as good as the other girl (or guy)
- looking like you don’t know what you’re doing
- of getting called out by someone prominent in the your industry

And now, the million dollar question. 

---
### Who would you be if none of that fear or doubt was holding you back?

---

What would you do if you didn’t worry about what someone else thought about you?

What project would you spend time on if you weren’t afraid of being judged by it?

What type of person would you be if you were free from fear, doubt and so many of the other negative scripts that cloud your judgement and ultimately your personal progress?

I struggle with this too. In fact, there's a part of me that's afraid you will think this entire post is stupid.

But if I **detach**, and set the fear aside, I have clarity and realize this is an ideal that’s important to me. One that I want to live by and teach my kids.

Just the other day, my oldest son was anxious about going to school with his new hair style because it was different than what he normally did, even though he really liked it.

I helped him fix his hair with some of my styling clay/paste/gel… whatever it is. 

On the way to school he flattened it all out and said he wasn’t ready to do his hair like that. I could sense his anxiety about the whole thing.

This is bigger than a hair style, it’s a worldview.

I want him to know that he shouldn’t let irrational fear drive his decision making. 

And I want you to know that too.

There are billions of people who have no opinion of you whatsoever. Focusing on that at a macro scale can help overcome the tiny echo chamber of your own social circle and get you moving in the right direction.

# Let's Not Kill the Hamburger Icon Just Yet

![kill hamburger](/content/images/2018/02/lidye-petit-300571.jpg)

Why don't we, I don't know, talk to it for a while - see if he'll give us any information. It's obvious he knows something, so before we go all fire and brimstone on him, let's tie him to a chair first and do a little friendly Q & A. Rough him up? Sure, but he's more valuable to us alive.

I don't know about you, but to me it seems like the general population in the tech industry is kind of, sort of obsessed with murder. 

>*"Kill the hamburger icon."*

>*"This is the [insert very useful software here] killer."*

>*"Finally putting [insert very useful software here] in its grave."*

>*"[This useful software] is dead."*

I get the idea behind statements like that, but letting it permeate every alternative option for software, menu icons, etc. seems a bit harsh, rushed, and quite honestly, dumb.

I'm glad that challenges exist and rise up, but not with such a dogmatic stance. It is important that there are serious advocates of the devil, who debate designs, add tension to taboo topics, and challenge the choices of designers and developers.

Being a devil's advocate is one thing, but completely dismissing and poopooing an idea is another. If we are to progress or advance with our design standards, our software - then we must be willing to try new things and have some healthy banter with opposing forces.

Let's not let phrases like *"user engagement was much lower with the hamburger icon as the navigation"* completely knock us off our idea horse, run to the nearest weapon and come back like a savage to kill anything unfamiliar like a treacherous enemy.

## Question First, Kill Later
Here is a good one to get us started:

>How important is the navigation for **my** project?

No matter the answer to the question, it is about one thing - *your project*. It doesn't automatically become gospel from the results of one user testing session or analytics read out that were unique to *your project.*

For the record, I've witnessed user testing for a huge national organization's new product rollout, and it was frightening how many assumptions were being made based on a tiny sampling of data from a single day *(roughly 6 users)* of testing.

Imagine this scenario. You have valuable content to show on the mobile rendition of your website. You've gone the extra mile to provide meaty content on the page. It's a delight to scroll through and read. Your content is *legitimately* being interacted with.

"But our analytics showed that user engagement was *much* lower with the navigation when it was a hamburger icon."

I can't think of a single website that has a goal of "clicking around in the navigation." If that is the primary concern, it may be possible that you are concerned with the wrong things.

On the other hand, if test data shows that the duration of someone's visit is 1 minute with an average of 3 pages visited, *with a completely exposed navigation that reads "Menu,"* but is reduced to 20 seconds with an average of 1 page visited *after condensing the navigation into a hamburger icon,* well then you have a little more to go on.

Even with the scenario above, more time on the site doesn't necessarily mean more engaged. It could mean *more confused*, especially if your primary objectives aren't being accomplished.

I just don't want us to get caught up in test data and interpret it the wrong way. I do believe reports that the majority of users don't know what the hamburger menu icon means. And yes, out of sight is out of mind. However, we need to remember that design is about putting focus on certain things and hiding others. Interface design is about the clever manipulation of objects for guiding humans to complete tasks. Let's keep those tasks in mind as we wade through our analytics. Let's hide some things and show others. Let's remember our purpose and not get too caught up in certain details if they are not crucial to our users' success.

## Hamburger Options
We've now realized that the hamburger menu icon has digital gluten, and should be avoided like the plague. No. We've come to understand a few things about the hamburger icon, but we have not concluded that it is clearly and utterly useless.

My favorite example of a potential hamburger icon usage option, is that of an *icon plus a label within a bounding box.*

![icon plus label within a bounding box](/content/images/2014/Jun/menu.png)

I believe it is *crucial* that we explore extremely condensed design patterns for mobile devices. This same thought process is what compelled me to design the [float label](http://mattdsmith.com/float-label-pattern) form interaction, when a traditionally labeled form just didn't feel right.

If we completely abandon patterns like the hamburger menu icon, we will limit the progression of our interfaces by polluting our thinking. We'll get caught up in a "the world is flat" mentality, when in fact it is round. Very round. If we are so prompt to put down new patterns, new ideas, we may *never* throw things around on a screen like with cool gloves like [Tom Cruise in the Minority Report.]() And dammit, I want to do that one day.

# Save Icon
![save icon](/content/images/2014/Jun/icon_4448-1.png)

The floppy disk icon became known as the *save icon* because it made sense. People understood that if they wanted to write data to a disk to save it, they needed to slide their old school gigantic mouse over to that 8bit icon and click it. There was contextual relevance.

Guys, we *need* the hamburger icon, or at least something like it. We can use a hotdog for all I care, but please - let's let the idea live and breathe. Something useful will come of it, I'm sure.

If the need arises to hide a navigation on a mobile view of a website, we need options. If we show the word "Menu" beside the hamburger icon long enough, people will begin to associate the icon with a navigation menu. This is no different than Pavlov and his dogs.

The same way the canines began to salivate with the ringing of a bell, so shall we begin to associate "Menu" with the hamburger icon if it is used long enough. This puts it on the path to eventually being used as an [icon only interface](http://mattdsmith.com/icon-only-interfaces/). 

The *save icon* was used so much and for so long that people began to associate that icon with *saving*, even if there was no floppy disk to save to. It took on meaning. Now we've come full circle where the save icon is becoming meaningless as our kids (future bearers of the internet) have no context for a floppy disk. In fact, they barely have context for a *click*. Just yesterday, my 4 year old was trying to swipe through Netlix with his finger on my iMac.

The point is, things evolve - especially interfaces. It seems as if every designer and their brother fancy the hamburger icon, so let's not destroy this pattern and tell everyone to stop using it. Let's steward it. Let's set it up for success. Let's create smart guidelines for usage for the future. Perhaps, most importantly, let's keep an open mind for advances in the world of interfaces.

Challenge ideas? Yes. 
Kill them quickly? No.

# High-Level Wireframe Design Intro with Illustrator

![wireframe](/content/images/2014/12/wireframe.png)

In the early stages of a project it can be helpful to *map out* as much of the experience as you can to help get everyone on the same page. Conversations and decisions often become a little more tangible when there is something to look at and point to.

Once you've got a solid list of screens or steps written out for your project and maybe even a [sitemap](/illustrator-sitemap/) created, you can make some great headway with this quick wireframing technique.

There are always constants between projects, such as the navigation for a website, a title, subheading, and a block of copy. Some buttons, etc. Even though the nomenclature for each component and user action may not be defined and signed off on, you can still get to work.

Watch the video below for an intro into creating these high-level (ie. abstract), placeholder components.

=== FILE: icon-only-interfaces.md ===
------------------------------
# Icon Only Interfaces


I recently read a Layer Vault post regarding progressive reduction. I love this concept, especially since I've always pushed to use "icon only" buttons when possible for interfaces. It works sometimes and other times, not so much.

Coming from a background of painting and drawing - I'm very much into fine arts and care deeply about composition, color, contrast, focal points, and more. So when I began crafting websites, usability was of no concern to me in the early days. I was creating art! This led to a slew of bad websites created with poor usability. One of my early pride and joys featured the main navigation as a row of 10 big icons along the top with no text labels (I was later forced into adding labels on hover). I did this because I thought it was sexy, but it was not usable. It was obnoxious and gratuitous as it only served me and not user.

##Sexy and Usable
Nowadays, I still want to make things sexy, but they have to be usable as well. I ran a quick test on dribbble the other day for a potential "check in" icon on an iPhone app. Only about 20% of the people guessed the function correctly. I made another post with a properly labeled icon and voila, no confusion. There are a number of apps using a check-in-type button - some of them like foursquare are using a "pin" icon only. This does make sense to a certain degree because you are pin pointing a location, but it's also not 100% clear what it does until you tap on it. To many people the "pin" icon means "location" but not necessarily "check in." 

##Icon Only Threshold
There seems to be this threshold of when it's safe to use "icon only" buttons and when it's not. Take Four Square for instance. You may not know what the pin icon does until you tap it, but once you do for the first time, maybe out of curiosity, you're likely to remember the function it performs since this is the main function of the app. This can be an effective method as long as the rest of your interface doesn't have a multitude of multiple icon only buttons that are not yet engrained into a user's preconceptions. This method is still risky because it's not guaranteed that a user will remember what the icon does.

##Facebook's Progressive Reduction
Facebook is another example of using "icon only' interface bits. Both desktop and mobile versions of the site have evolved to have the same consistent icons along the top - Friend Requests, Messages, and Notifications. It would be virtually impossible to elegantly include those functions (especially on mobile) by including long text labels with each icon. Facebook has evolved, or should I say "progressively reduced," into this. This would have been quite confusing for first time users who had no reference to what those icons might mean. But over time users began to expect friend requests, messages sent, and notifications. Facebook was able to evolve into a simpler interface because the users became more familiar with the content and where to find it. The same now is true for the 3-line nav icon. The nav icon still may not be universally accepted by all, but I believe this simple solution will become a usability standard very soon. It's simpler and sexier to have 3 lines than the word "Menu" or "Navigation," plus this gives more room for a title on mobile. But again you've got to consider your audience to know whether that is going to be sufficient.

##Remember Tweetie?
Tweetie was the first solid Twitter app for the iPhone and the Mac. Unlike Twitter's mobile app today, Tweetie used an icon only navigation. Since Twitter has a relatively simple content set, it's a good example of when it works to use an icon only navigation. Tweetie used 5 icons on the mobile app - timeline, mentions, direct messages, search, and more. (Not unlike Tweetbot today.) Timeline and Mentions are the two of the most used areas on Twitter for so it's easy to recognize them in an icon only line up, especially since the @ symbol has become very much associated with Twitter. The search and "more" icon are easily recognized as well. The icons were sexy and were an easy shoe in for more seasoned users. Even the less explanatory icons, revealed when swiping a tweet, became quickly apparent after using the app a few times. Since Twitter has a limited feature set it provides a nice scenario to explore an icon only approach.

I can imagine though, Twitter didn't want to alienate users who were new to the service with icons only on their apps. Shortly after Twitter acquired Tweetie, they rebranded the app, changed a few things up and added the text labels to the nav bar. Not as sexy per se, but the labels are of huge value for new users and from a general usability perspective.

##Final Thoughts
The truth is, it's easier to design with icons only within an interface because you can nail them down to a fit within a square grid that doesn't fluctuate in width or height. Icons with text labels becomes a whole new story. Icons with text labels are harder to deal with - enter copywriting, nomenclature, varying widths, typography, text color, text size, etc. This opens a whole new can of worms and can be difficult to deal with. As a designer, I urge you to take the challenge. Don't just come up with beautiful icons and call it a day. Think about the use of labels. If they're needed what should each one be called? Can they all be reduced to one word? What is the longest possible text label? Keep all of these in mind, in addition to making the icons look sexy.

Think of scenarios that lend themselves to progressive reduction and push for simpler interfaces, but don't forgo usability.

# Create Presentation Ready PDFs with Artboards in Illustrator

![pdf](/content/images/2014/12/pdf.png)

Ignoring artboards contributes a lot to the super-speedy, wireframe design process that can be accomplished with Adobe Illustrator. 99% of the time, I leave artboards hidden and only toggling their visibility and manipulating them only when I'm ready to export a PDF for presentation purposes.

This is similar to drawing on a big whiteboard with dry-erase markers and snapping a pic to capture everything before it's erased. Illustrator is your whiteboard and artboards are you pic-snap at the end.

You'll be surprised how fast you can churn out screens by blazing through the design process without fussing with artboards or layers. There always comes a time however, when you need to share your work. I wrote about a [crazy detailed method](/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/) for large complex projects, but most of the time simple artboards will do.

Wrangle artboards like a pro by watching the video below.

# How to Create a Sitemap in Illustrator

![sitemap](/content/images/2014/12/sitemap-1.png)
When you're working on a website, web application, or a mobile app, it helps to map out the experience before you dive too deep into the weeds of design decisions.

It took roughly 6 minutes to design the sitemap above. The video below is sped up 2X so you can see the process a little faster.

In the video, you'll see how you can quickly create a sitemap using the Rectangle tool `M` and the Line tool <code>\</code>. Couple those two things with the versatility of the Direct select tool `A`, and you've got yourself a lightening fast way to create.

## Moving and Duplicating
Once you've created an object that you'd like to duplicate, you can hit `cmd+shift+m` to *move* it any desired amount horizontally or vertically. Hitting `copy` instead of `OK` allows you to hit `cmd+D` afterwards to duplicate the same command as many times as you'd like.

![move and copy](/content/images/2014/12/move-copy.png)

## Slower Walkthrough Video
Because of some [great feedback](https://twitter.com/marcelosomers/status/540549182449127424) on the faster video above, I've recorded another slower version that you can follow along and see each click and drag, step by step.

# Intro to Icons Breakdown

{% if subscriber.first_name != blank %}{{ subscriber.first_name }}!{% else %}Hey there!{% endif %}

I'm writing to you from 30,000 feet up in the air on the way to
SF for a few days. I'm getting interviewed for an episode of
"Make it," a YouTube show produced by Adobe. I'm not 100% sure of
everything that we'll cover, but I do think I'll get to share
more about the Intro to Icons course with them.

Speaking of...

I'm simply and utterly blown away by the response after launching
http://introtoicons.com ( http://introtoicons.com ) last week.

Seriously, my mind is blown...

It's still gaining traction and publicity on more and more sites
this week. Just today I found it posted on a big German news site
called t3n ( http://t3n.de/news/icons-gestalten-online-kurs-825330/ ). They
sure did pick a good still from the trailer video. 😆

Overages for days

I've been notified by GoSquared, Wistia, Heroku, and MediaTemple
that I've exceeded bandwidth on each of the services and my cost
will increase accordingly... oops.

Fortunately those services scale up automatically without service
interruption.

So while IT IS and will continue to be FREE, I am indeed
incurring costs.

More on that later...

Since this was one of my most successful launches ever
(traffic-wise),

I thought it would be fun to share some of the numbers.

Here are a few screenshots from my GoSquared analytics dashboard.

All of the numbers span last week Monday – Sunday

Image

Image

Image

* 10.5k total visits
* 8,675 unique visitors
* 2,480 of that from external sites
* 2,354 from social media (mostly Twitter)
* 5,613 from "other" (direct links, etc.)
* 138 different countries visited the site

And perhaps the most important number...

Total signups so far

2,786 sign ups so far out of 8,675 unique visitors.

That's a conversion rate of 32% per visitor. Not too shabby!

I put tracking code on each of the site's buttons too, to see how
many times each one got clicked.

Image

It's no surprise that the giant, orange, primary call-to-action
dominates the others with a whopping 2,502 clicks.

I was surprised though that the CTA in the second section, a full
scroll down, won over the "watch trailer" secondary CTA in the
main area at the top.

The top 4 highest performing CTAs were:

1. "Join & Get Instant Access" (orange CTA at the top)

2. "I must know those 3 traits" (secondary CTA in second panel)

3. "Watch Trailer" (secondary CTA at the top)

4. "Oh heck yes" (orange CTA at the bottom)

To see some more behind the scenes of the site design, you can
watch the video on YouTube ( https://youtu.be/1hCXBs2fJcc ).

6 Lessons Learned

1. It pays to be patient. I had the course populated and ready a
few weeks before I launched it to the public, but I did go ahead
and release it early to around 100 people who were on the waiting
list. This always, always helps to get feedback and testimonials
for when you go live for real. Heck, I even recorded all of the
videos back in January, but wanted to wait to release them until
I had everything buttoned up nicely.

2. It pays to invest in design. I could have rushed the course
out early and written a little blog post on my own personal site
with a few screenshots. And it may have even been a "successful"
launch. But I do believe that because I spent nearly a full week
(probably more) designing and developing a completely custom and
fully designed and developed landing page, that it helped
increase the course's share-ability.

3. The better it looks, the better it shares. I don't think the
design is groundbreaking or anything, but I did spend a lot of
time going over every little detail—screen sizes, animations,
rollovers, colors, gradients, tweaking CSS over and over until it
felt right. I had lots of comments and questions about the site
and the custom course app and this undeniably created more buzz.

4. Pay close attention to the copy, not just the design. It helps
to think about the headline of the site and the first tweet. I
could have easily slapped "Intro to Icons" in the header and it
would have looked nice, but I spent days thinking about the
perfect headline that hit a pain point. People don't have a lot
of time and all of the videos totaled less than an hour. Aha!
Learn the fundamentals of icon design in one hour. It makes a
promise to deliver a skill within a certain timeframe. Much more
compelling than the title of the course by itself.

5. Plan for social media. You definitely need to consider the
meta tags for your website, which control which image shows up
when people share the URL. For example, here's a link to the
image that shows up for Intro to Icons ( http://aiux-production.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/intro-icons-card.png )... And you can't necessarily count on people doing a lot of
sharing all by themselves. You should try to incorporate it into
the flow. Now, I'm not a big fan of "sharing to unlock" goods or
anything like that. The idea of forcing someone to tweet to gain
access to content just feels too gimmicky to me. So instead I
provided lots of opportunity for sharing. For example, when you
sign up you get straight into the course, but then the email that
gets sent to you is short and sweet and the biggest call to
action is "it would mean the world to me if you could share this
on twitter". Then that's linked up using the tweet-intent method
that Twitter provides.

I also emailed the existing 100+ people who were already in the
course to let them know the landing page was live and to ask if
they would share on Twitter. Lots of people took advantage of
that simple tweet method. You can see for yourself by searching
introtoicons.com on Twitter ( https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=introtoicons.com&src=typd ).

6. Free has a cost. Someone has to bear the cost of free goods.
In this case it's me. I have absolute zero complaints about this
project, but I do want to point out that this isn't free for to
host, produce, edit, spend time on, etc. I've invested weeks of
time and cash into making it publicly available. So be aware of
that the next time you think of offering something for free. Make
sure that you understand the cost and potential benefits. The
benefits need to outweigh the cost. The benefits of this course
are as follow: I get to sharing valuable information for free
with the design community at large, I get to grow my email list,
and I get lots of great feedback on what people want for a deeper
dive on an expanded course. Wins all around.

So...

{% if subscriber.tags contains "In Intro to Icons Course" %}

Because you are one of the fabulous human beings that signed up
for the course, I'd LOVE for you to reply to this email and let
me know what you'd like to see a deeper dive on.

Some ideas:
* simply more icon how to's
* more Illustrator
* doing the same thing in Sketch (other software?)
* using icons with interfaces
* more SVG code

You tell me..

What would you like to see covered in an expanded Icons course?

I'm planning the future version of this course and would love to
have you lead its direction, based on what you'd like to learn
more of.

{% else %}

Because you haven't signed up for the free course yet, I want to
give you a handy dandy link to do just that. No pressure!!

# How to Create an iPad Wireframe and Mobile Safari Icons

![ipad](/content/images/2014/12/ipad.png)

Continuing on with [AIUX](/aiux) series, we’re going to look at creating an iPad wireframe and mobile Safari icons, by repurposing a few items from the [iPhone we created](how-to-create-an-iphone-wireframe/).

Now I’ve already covered [iPhone wireframe creation](/how-to-create-an-iphone-wireframe), which is essentially the same method for the iPad, so in this video, instead of drawing out the iPad shape, I’m focussing a more on some path techniques that come in handy when creating icons.

Some of the main tools used here are:

- Select Tool `V`
- Direct Select `A`
- Pen Tool `P`
- Modifier Keys - `cmd` and `opt`

With the pen tool `P` selected, you can hold `cmd` to temporarily change to the last selection tool used, whether it was `V` or `A`. You can also hold the `opt` key with the pen tool selected to allow you to manipulate the handlebars for anchor points.

Watch the video below for further explanation. *Pardon the clickety clacks, I recorded this without my [proper setup](/buying-audio-equipment).*

# Jack Black on Writing

I recently heard this radio interview on NPR during a drive home from work.

>"You're going to have to do some writing. Let's face it. The great comedians now that are handicapped in the looks department are tremendous writers. I'm not gonna say who they are because now they'll be offended. But you know who you are. That's what I tell anyone who approaches me that wants a career like mine. I say, well you better get to the writing. I didn't really have anything going until I started writing songs and sketches for Tenacious D. It's not enough just to be an actor anymore, you have to bring a whole skill-set."

# Killing It

I’m reading a book, “[Revising Prose](mds.io/YyzH)” by Richard A. Lanham, in which he writes about the imbalance of nouns and verbs in the *Official Style*, a formal language used to sound more professional.

*He writes:*
>...they all build on the same imbalance: a dominance of nouns and an atrophy of verbs. They enshrine the triumph, worshipped in every bureaucracy, of stasis over action.

The verb "*is*" takes the stage in the book as a commonly used part of speech, rather than active verbs. Read the following sentence for example:

>This sentence *is* in need of an active verb.

As opposed to the more active:

>This sentence needs an active verb.

Similarly, "*Killing it*" has littered our communication as a lazy cover-all for doing something well. It does have some impact, but the punch is lost with frequent use, so I’ve decided to provide some alternatives.

## Adjectives
- Impressive 
- Astonishing
- Beautiful
- Breathtaking
- Magnificent
- Stunning
- Wonderful
- Moving
- Mind-blowing 
- Fascinating
- Marvelous
- Prodigious
- Fantastic
- Tremendous
- Monumental
- Stupendous
- Inordinate
- Unbelievable
- Remarkable
- Solid

I’ll stop there, but the list could go on and on.

## Nouns
- Presentation
- Product
- Layout
- Design
- Work
- Skills
- Talent
- Person
- Speaker
- Conversation

## Combinations
- Impressive presentation
- Astonishing product
- Beautiful layout
- Breathtaking design
- Magnificent work
- Stunning skills
- Mind-blowing talent
- Marvelous person
- Prodigious speaker
- Remarkable conversation

Compare any of those combinations to "*killing it*" and you may discover they more accurately express your thoughts.

# Leaning in at an Angle

A sailboat can’t make any progress without wind, in fact going straight ahead into the wind will get you nowhere. Your boat won’t move forward at all. 

You move the fastest sailing against the wind. Not directly head on, but at an angle. This creates a tension between the sails and the hull. This tension generates power giving you the ability to move *faster* than the wind. Voila, sailing!

In our work, it comes natural to completely oppose someone’s opinion with an equal and opposite view point of our own.

>“Designers should code their own designs. Photoshop is dead. Don’t waste your time using wireframes; you should go straight to prototyping instead. You should do this instead of that. Don’t create a desktop psd and a mobile psd. Look at how horrible *this* example is.”

What if we designed and coded, prototyped and wireframed? What if we harnessed the power of each individual tool into our collective processes? What if instead of calling someone or something stupid, we leaned in at an angle and actually made some head way?

# Phil's New Site

Phil Coffman just made a [new personal website](https://philcoffman.com). It's got texture (what!? in 2019!? yes!!), cursive web fonts, and good 'ol fashion personal writing.

![phil's new site](/content/images/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-20-at-4.41.46-PM.png)

I know the struggle all too well, when it comes to personal sites. There are a million reasons why NOT to put your personal site up, but ultimately it's up to you to push it through. Well done, Phil.

Even writing a blog post (like this) at some point becomes a mental hurdle. Thanks to Phil for reminding me that I too have a personal site where I can freely write random personal thoughts without having to feel too overly-pressured to create the greatest long-form content of all-time.

It's a fresh reminder that personal blogs are like an expanded version of a tweet. It doesn't always need to serve a positive objective purpose. It can be total cathartic rambling, or not that at all.

Buuuuuuut.... the interface designer in me can't write a post without a clear call-to-action, so...

# Live Prototyping with Adobe XD

![san franwich co](/content/images/2016/12/san-franwich-co@2x.png)

A few weeks ago I was invited by Adobe to livestream my app design process on [adobelive.com](http://adobelive.com), hosted by [Paul Trani](http://twitter.com/paultrani) and [Michael Chaize](http://twitter.com/mchaize). The goal was to show how to solve a design problem with Adobe XD.

After some deliberation, I decided to design a simple sandwich building app for a fictitious company called, **San Franwich Co.**

Below are some sketches and notes I put together on the plane headed to SF. I even wrote a small project brief and a few requirements for the app.

![sketchbook picture of a user flow and some notes](/content/images/2016/12/sketchbook-mds.jpg)

---

#### Project Brief
*San Franwich Co., a super-fast custom sandwich delivery company, wants to build an iOS app to allow customers to digitally create sandwiches and have them delivered.*

#### Project Requirements
- Build a custom sandwich
- Have it delivered
- Track progress
- Repeat orders
- **Speed!** It’s gotta be fast

---

I was initially worried that that would be too little content to cover over the course of 3 days—roughly two hours per day. As usual—when preparing material for a workshop or a talk—my concerns were dwarfed by the fact that we barely got through with the custom builder only and not much more.

Overall, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive and I had a great time. Here’s a recording of each day’s session along with some notes about what was covered.

## Day 1 of 3
During Day 1 all of the introductions were made, the project was introduced and we did a lot of planning and began the low fidelity wireframing process.

<div class="video-wrapper">

## Day 2 of 3
Continuing right were we left off the day before, we tackled the remaining wireframes for the custom sandwich builder.

</div>

## Day 3 of 3
The final day we started the user interface (UI) designs and created as many screens as possible during the short amount of time. Lots of little UI details and XD tips were uncovered.

<div class="video-wrapper">

## Wireframe Prototype
This is the low fidelity wireframe we created during the first two days. This prototype `embed code` was exported directly from XD with the click of a button. [Visit the lo-fi prototype here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/e1d72386-a230-4868-9601-78abf508ae66/) to see it in context with the comments the audience left.

## User Interface Prototype
On the last day we explored a visual direction and created the UI for the app. You can [view the prototype with comments here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/139a36e4-8e61-4fe4-adcb-7413a56f5cd9/).

## 3 Techniques for Creating Rounded Rectangles in Older Versions of Illustrator
I’ve had several people comment on previous tutorials that they were using older versions of Adobe Illustrator, which don’t support the corner radius option for rectangles. So for this video, we’re going to see how to create them using a few different techniques.

1. Drawing rounded rectangles from the tool panel
2. Use the pen tool to add a radius to a rectangle
3. Merge circles and rectangles with the pathfinder to form rounded rectangles

Watch the video below to see the step by step.

# Make an Excuse or Make a Way

<iframe src='https://spoken.co/t/2487305/embedembed' frameborder='0' width='100%' height='84'></iframe>

5 years ago I looked at some recent pictures of myself and thought, “Good God, I’m fat.” Not just a few pounds, but nearly 20-30 pounds over what had always been my normal weight. This was after working from my home office for 2 years and being extremely non-physical. I’d wake up, sometimes put on pants, go upstairs to my office and get started. There I'd sit like a blob in front of a glowing box for 8+ hours. 

After seeing those photos, and starting a new year, I picked up P90X in January 2010 and stuck with it for a solid 60 days, then sort of petered out in the last month. Committing to 1.5 hours, 6 days a week was tough especially while trying to not neglect my wife and kids. 

Despite seeing significant improvements in my body composition, I told myself that work had gotten too busy for me to keep up that workout pace. That statement had a twinge of truth, but ultimately *it is what I chose to believe.*

A few months went by and I tried P90X again for a month or so, then the same thing happened. I convinced myself that I didn’t have enough time to do these workouts everyday. I was also really tired of Tony Hortman’s one-liners and had just lost interest in the DVDs altogether. 

>There is a sliver of truth in all of the excuses we tell ourselves about why we can’t accomplish something or why we don’t have the time, but the fact is **we can find an excuse or find a way**. 

In 2013, I bought a bike so I could commute from my house to my office, roughly an 11 mile round-trip. I started to [really enjoy riding a bike again](riding-again/) for the first time since I was a teenager. Soon I started going for longer rides after work. Eventually 20 mile rides, then 30. Then I bought a proper road bike and kept it up. In 2014 I rode over 1,600 miles during the summer and fall. I wasn’t finding excuses why I couldn’t ride, I was finding ways **to** ride. I loved it.

But then winter hit and my road bike got parked, I “got busy with work” again and I stopped working out for a few months. The new year came and I was pissed off with myself. I was tired of telling myself that I was too busy, that I didn’t have time. We all have the exact same amount of time in the day. Other people find time to workout, why can’t I? 

Something switched mentally early this year. I **just decided** that I would workout regularly no matter what. Since it was too cold to ride my bike most days in early January, I decided to lift weights 3~ times a week at the local YMCA and started to really enjoy it. I did this for 3 to 4 months and now that it’s warm again, I’ve dusted off the bike and saddled up a handful of times. Sometimes I lift weights, sometimes I ride my bike, sometimes I run.

There are plenty of times when I legitimately don’t have time for a 2 hour bike ride without neglecting my wife and [four kids](/four), so I go for a run at night after everyone is asleep. Now, I try to find a way.

For a long time I would make excuses for why I didn’t accomplish the things I set out to do. In fact, I still fall into the trap of making excuses for not doing the things I want. And more often than not they’re very real and legitimate. But as time passes and I get older it’s easy to see that you can make excuses or you can make a way. 

Now, I’m determined to make a way. How about you?

# Good Button

Good Button is a button created with Sassy goodness that actually looks like a button. It's flat(ish), but still has those subtle gradients, inner-shadows, and drop shadows that give a button its buttonness. Feed Good Button a few variables and the mixin takes care of the rest. Go nuts with the clicking and what not.

# Products

At some point during my design career I decided to start building things for myself instead of only building things for clients. Here are some of those things.

## Shift Nudge
![shift nudge icons](/content/images/2019/12/shiftnudge.gif)

Shift Nudge is my current primary focus. It's an intensive interface design course with a heavy focus on visual tactics. Taught through the lens of UX, the lessons go extremely deep on the visual process to create beautiful interfaces. Currently in testing in Private Beta, with the public launch planned for early 2020.

👉 https://shiftnudge.com

---

## Flowkit
![flowkit](/content/images/2019/12/figma-flowkit-cover.png)

Flowkit is a tool that I created for myself out of sheer frustration. Drawing lines and end points in Sketch, Figma, or XD is way bigger of a pain than it should be, especially if you just want to show a quick flow for an app feature. That's why I over-engineered the ever-loving-crap out of this. Now we never have to worry about drawing those lines again.

👉 http://useflowkit.com

---

## Contrast 
![contrast](/content/images/2019/12/contrast-card-v0.2.jpg)

Having accessible interfaces is kind of a big deal and it usually starts with proper contrast between your text foreground and background color. This is a handy little Mac menu bar app that allows you to test your interface contrast quickly.

## Intro to Icons
![](/content/images/2019/12/intro-icons-card-v2.png)

A while back, Adobe invited me to teach a few workshops at Adobe MAX. I received great feedback and decided to turn the workshop into a quick little FREE video course.

## Streamline Icons
![](/content/images/2019/12/streamline3-card.jpg)

A recent collaboration with [Vincent Le Moign](http://twitter.com/webalys), creator of Streamline. I partnered with him to create the brand new website for the Streamline 3.0 release. Over 30,000 icons!

---

## AIUX
![aiux](/content/images/2019/12/aiux-card.jpg)

Several years ago, I used Illustrator almost exclusively for all of my UX design, wireframes, flows, etc. I made a really in depth course that outlines my entire process for designing a big responsive site's wireframes. If Illustrator is your thing, this is definitely for you. Because it's a few years old, I don't promote it much.

## Zoom
![zoom](/content/images/2020/05/zoom_2.svg)

Zoom is a font I created as an extension of some branding I did for a local cycling team. This is a sleek and extended font family designed for top speed while squeezing into tight places.

## Back in the Day
I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2005 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design and the following year, interned at the UGA Wesley Foundation, a Christian college ministry. 

Illustration was my unofficial career path at the time of graduation, but as the world so quickly pressed me to make real money, I took a job as an in-house designer with a cycling component manufacturer just outside of Athens. It was there that I began to make many awesomely bad Flash websites, design product identities, and virtually anything else that was needed. Additional responsibilities included (but not limited to): filming, video editing, bobcat operation, construction, CNC machine operation, powder coating, laser cutting, and more.

It was through those Flash websites, where I began to learn about object-oriented programming, interaction design, and animation. 

After a few years, I ventured into contracting for some larger digital agencies based in Atlanta, where I became engulfed in information architecture and user experience design. My eyes were opened to a new world and I began to truly feel at home in the professional community, with a newfound higher calling.

More time passed and I contracted for nearly a dozen agencies, seeing the good, the bad, and the ugly when it came to project management, design culture, and general client services.

Because of the nature of my transient employment as a freelancer  and contractor, it was imperative that I adapted to each new environment and adopted the culture and political climate as quickly as possible. I observed and quickly found ways to relate to colleagues around me, while treading the delicate line of being personable yet professional. My [college job](/caddy) helped with that too.

## Current
I take great pride in my ability to communicate and articulate ideas through design and visual language, but perhaps more importantly through soft personal skills. Reading body language, intently listening, being persuasive, and empathizing are all part of my designer toolkit.

Nowadays, I won't start on a project unless I know the *why* behind it. I can't do my job effectively unless every screen, block of copy, or interface bit has an intentional value assigned, all supporting user goals first and business goals second. You can read more about my work, [here](/working).

<!-- 
>Matt provided excellent creative/visual design work for several large-scale programs that I led as the Director of Custom Branded Solutions at Yahoo! His creativity, communication skills, and understanding of our customers was a refreshing approach. Matt seems to focus on design that has business sense, rather than designing heavy creative just to be creative.

# How to Create a Mobile Safari, Title Bar Wireframe with Illustrator

![mobile safari](/content/images/2014/12/mobile-safari.gif)
In this second post in the [AIUX](/aiux) series, we'll walk through creating a mobile Safari title bar wireframe. In the [last video](/how-to-create-an-iphone-wireframe) we created the base iPhone wireframe, so now we'll add a title bar so it can be used as a base for mobile-first website designs. Check out the video below.

# My Favorite Way to Write

![iA Writer](/content/images/2014/Mar/favorite_way_to_write.png)

This is my favorite way to write: [Fullscreen iA writer](http://mds.io/UHdU) with the colors inverted. My first thought was to simply tweet this and leave it at that, but perhaps I can spread the love a bit more.

First purchase [iA writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/) if don't own it. It's really great. Ok got it? Now launch it. ⌘+D will put you in focus mode.

Then to give it that extra little something, especially if you're writing early in the morning or late at night, invert your screen. There are two ways to do it. The manual and less cool way, and the quick key awesome-sauce way. Here's how to do it.

## Invert manually (less cool)
Here's how to invert the colors manually each time, which is pretty lame. But knowledge is power, my friend.

Go to system preferences and choose *Accessibility*.

![system preferences accessibility](/content/images/2014/Mar/sys_pref_accessibility.png)

Now make sure *Display* is selected.

![system preferences display](/content/images/2014/Mar/accessibility_display.png)

Lastly, choose *Invert Colors*.

![system preferences invert](/content/images/2014/Mar/accessibility_display_invert.png)

That's one way to do it, but that's also slow and cumbersome. If you decide that you like writing with colors inverted, you're really going to want the quick key option below.

## Invert with a quick key (awesome-sauce)
Here's what you really want. To wield the power of color inversion at your will with the speed of a cougar.

Go to system preferences and choose *Keyboard*.

![system preferences keyboard](/content/images/2014/Mar/sys_pref_keyboard.png)

Now click on *Shortcuts* in the view switcher.

![system preferences shortcuts](/content/images/2014/Mar/keyboard.png)

Select *Accessibility* in the left panel, then make sure *Invert Colors* is selected. The quick key is **⌘+Option+Ctrl+8** if you're like me and still can't remember the difference between all of those symbols.

![system preferences accessibility invert colors](/content/images/2014/Mar/invert_shortcut.png)

There you go amigo, now you can enjoy the same writing setup as me. It's kind of like when you tell a friend to look at the moon at the exact same time when you're in different places and you'll know that you're both doing that together. Ok nevermind, it's nothing like that.

For extra goodness, here is an example of this post written in the aforementioned style. [See it larger](http://mds.io/UHcB).

# Is the New Retina Macbook Powerful Enough to be Used as Your Main Machine?

That really depends on what you expect from your main machine now doesn’t it? While I haven’t used the new [Retina MacBooks](http://apple.com/macbook), I can tell you about the 2013 MacBook Air, which has similar specs and has served me incredibly well as my main and only machine over the last 2 years doing full-time design. Also note, I designed 95% of the time with my MacBook Air hooked up to my 27” Apple Cinema Display.

My 2013 MacBook Air had the following specs:

- **MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013)**
- **Processor** 1.7GHz Intel Core i7
- **Memory** 8GB 1600 MHz DDR3
- **Graphics** Intel HD Graphics 5000 1536MB
- **Storage** 512GB flash storage

The new (maxed-out) Retina MacBook has similar specs with a few differences:

- **MacBook (12-inch, Retina, Mid 2015)**
- **Processor** 1.3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core M, Turbo Boost up to 2.9 GHz
- **Memory** 8 GB 1600 MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM
- **Graphics** Intel HD Graphics 5300
- **Storage** 512GB flash storage

The biggest differences are the processor and the graphics. The i7 (Air) seems faster than the Core M (MacBook) according to [this comparison](http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i7-4500U-vs-Intel-Core-M-5Y70). But again, my Air didn’t have a dual core and didn’t have turbo boost. I'm definitely no processor expert.

According to [this review of the 2015 MacBook's performance](http://www.anandtech.com/show/9136/the-2015-macbook-review/9), the MacBook might not be as powerful as the Air over the course of a full day, but can be for short bursts of time, hence the turbo boost. *Thanks to [Marcelo Somers](https://twitter.com/marcelosomers) for pointing that article out.*

In the chart below, the new 2015 MacBook appears a good bit slower than the 2013 MacBook Air i7 when using Photoshop. 28s (MB) compared to 22.6 (MBA) seconds. And also see that the rMBP crushes both of them at 12s– that's with a 2.2GHz i7 from 2014, let alone the 3.1GHz you can now get with the rMBP.

![photoshop usage stats](http://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph9136/73534.png)
*courtesy of [Anandtech](http://www.anandtech.com/show/9136/the-2015-macbook-review/9)*

---

This graph alone make me pretty wary of using a MacBook for my main machine, but I still bet you could get by with it if you were determined enough. 

My Air also didn’t have a retina display and the colors weren’t nearly as vivid as my 27” external monitor. This was my biggest gripe with my Air, albeit not a huge gripe. It wasn’t bad, but compared to my cinema display it was very noticeably not as good. The new Retina MacBooks seem to have a better display, but I haven’t used one in person so I can’t confirm how good it is compared to its older brother, the MacBook Pro, which I can tell you with certainty that it's the *best monitor I've ever stared into*. The Macbook Pro has an Intel Iris Graphics 6100 compared to the MacBook’s Intel HD Graphics 5300.

## Can it Handle Large Design Files?
I frequently use Sketch for UI design as well as the full Adobe CC Suite– Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Flash, After Effects, etc. I use all of this for interface design for large responsive web applications (mobile, desktop, tablet) and iOS and Android app design. I’ve worked with really large wireframe files in Illustrator and really large UI design documents in Sketch. In fact, some of my Sketch UI design files have had up to 20 pages with 8-10 artboards on each page. I've also cranked through large and heavily layered PSDs with my Air.

**I’ve never had a situation where I felt like my 2013 MacBook Air was incapable of handling these design files**. *I did* notice the occasional lagginess when files would get really really large and in those cases I would typically break those files into multiple PSDs or multiple Sketch files. I did all of this from my 2013 MacBook Air hooked up to a 27” Cinema Display.

The new MacBook won't perform as well as the Air with large design files all day. You could probably manage it carefully and get by, but I wouldn't want to do that. Remember the Photshop speed test:

- 2015 MB 28s 
- 2013 MBA 22.6s 
- 2014 rMBP 12s

## Should I Get a New MacBook or a New MacBook Pro?
Well, that’s up to you. If you’ve been on a Pro for a while and you’re looking to change things up with the cool new MacBooks, I’d be a little concerned about processing power when handling huge files for a full day. I had a blast with my super thin and lightweight Air though.

Since I’ve been on the Air for the last 2 years I was looking to switch things up, so I recently decided to go with a fully maxed out MacBook Pro. Here are the specs on that for comparison: 

- **MacBook Pro (13-inch, Retina, Early 2015)**
- **Processor** 3.1GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz
- **Memory** 16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM
- **Graphics** Intel Iris Graphics 6100
- **Storage** 1TB PCIe-based Flash Storage

This thing is a beast. Quite a big difference between the new MacBook and the Pro, but like I said, I’ve been really happy with my Air over the last two years– so if you go for the new MacBook, theres a good chance it could work for you, but if you're on the fence power-wise and anticipate designing all day long like me, I'd 100% stick with a Pro.

# Nixon

![nixon](/content/images/2014/May/untitled_3.jpg)

Say hello to *Nixon Pierre Smith*, my fourth child (third son) born on May 13, 2014 at 1:56pm. Nixon was warmly welcomed by his brothers Noah (6) and Justice (4), and his sister Isa (2).

The name *Nixon* is a derivative of *Nicholas* or *son of Nicholas*. A contraction of *Nick's son.*

Mythological *Nike* was the Greek goddess of victory and the root origin of *Nicholas*, which comes from the Greek name *Nikolaos*. 

*Victory of the people* comes from Greek *nike* for *victory* and *laos* for *people.*

Nixon's middle name, *Pierre*, is my father's first name, whom was named by my Grandmother Maria Smith. She always loved the name *Pierre.* It's a great joy to honor my father in this way. *Pierre* is a derivative of *Peter*, which means *stone or rock.*

# 1 Hour of Free UX Consulting for Your Project

I recently tweeted to see if anyone was interested in getting one hour of free UX consulting on any design problem they may have. The only catch is I get to record the session and post the video on my blog with a short write-up.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rephrasing the prev question…&#10;&#10;Any takers on a 1 hour recorded session of design help for free?</p>&mdash; Matt D. Smith (@mds) <a href="https://twitter.com/mds/status/632242503794749440">August 14, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

![just do it](/content/images/2015/08/shia-just-do-it.gif)

<p style="text-align: center">Still not sure? Read on, my friend.</p>

---

I had quite a few responses, but the sentence alone was slightly vague so let me unpack it a little more. Ideally, you’ll have a responsive web project or iOS app that you’d like some UX help on. By the end of the session I hope to solve your problem or at least point you in the right direction, using the same techniques I teach in my upcoming [AIUX course.](/aiux) I’m looking for people who:

- have an app idea, but are struggling on nailing down certain functionality
- have an existing product, website, or app, but are experiencing problems with a specific area.
- want to learn more about how to use Illustrator in general, for UX design.
- would like a second opinion about existing designs, or ways to optimize something that has already been designed.

I’d like to setup a minimum of one session per week, and if the series proves valuable for others, I may devote a half-day to recording sessions and post them once or twice per week. 

## The Format
- You’ll spend the first 5-10 minutes on the phone, Skype, etc. with me introducing yourself and telling me what you hope to accomplish during our session. I’ll need specifics, pretty please. For example, “I want to learn more about UX design” wouldn’t be a great topic for a short session, but “I’d like to learn more about UX design in regards to mobile form design for online shopping” would be great.
- Next we’ll spend another 5-10 minutes talking through your topic and I’ll ask lots of questions.
- Once I feel like I have a good handle on your topic, we’ll get started designing things live and talking through the whole thing.
- My goal will be to leave you with some solid progress made towards solving your problem. I’ll gladly give you any and all files that I design.
- Afterwards, I’ll make some quick edits and post it on the blog.

Don’t be shy. If you’re a student, a professional designer, professional developer, a CEO, head of product, etc. [let’s get you on the list](https://www.getdrip.com/forms/76953217/submissions/new) to get notified when I open more 1 hour sessions.

## Interesting, but nah
That's cool. If you don't have a need for this, but think someone else could benefit, do me a favor and help spread the word. I will give you one internet high five and a real one if we ever meet in person.

# Create an OS X Status Bar and Safari Title Bar with Illustrator

![mac osx status bar and safari](/content/images/2014/12/tinymac.png)

To finish off the device wireframes ([iPhone](/how-to-create-an-iphone-wireframe/), [iPad](/ipad-mobile-safari/), and [Macbook Pro](/macbook-wireframe/)) created for [AIUX](/aiux), we’re creating the OS X status bar and a Safari title bar.

Simple shapes form the backbone of these icons&#8212;the wifi symbol consists of circles chopped off in a wedge shape. The sound icon builds around a few rectangles. The search icon is a mere circle and a line. Once you get a handle on the ins and outs of creating these shapes, you’ll be on your way to create your own set of icons.

# Introducing Particle

![particle](/content/images/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-11.30.31-AM.png)

**Particle** is what I named the theme that I created for my site's refresh. The name randomly popped in my head very early on in my redesign process and I decided to go with it. No hidden meaning or anything like that.

I haven’t historically named a new design of my own, but doing so helped me detach the project from my own identity in a way. Thinking of “your personal website” can be so daunting since it’s tied up in your ego and insecurities, but thinking of “A theme name” and designing for that, provides a good distance to make good progress.

Designing a website for yourself is hard. There are typically no constraints and no deadlines and that’s a recipe for disaster from the very beginning. 

That’s why when I started this particular blog 3 years ago, I installed the default version of [Ghost](http://tryghost.org) and just started writing. 

I needed to remove the excuse of *perfectionism* from my pool of reasons why I hadn’t started writing.

After some time had passed, I customized the default Ghost theme, Casper, with a few of my own tweaks, but it was all made of hacks on top of the default code base. That always bothered me.

With this new version of the site, I decided to rewrite a new theme completely from scratch. Very early on I called it **Particle** and the name kinda stuck. 

Earlier on I created a few designs in Sketch when the urge to redesign would strike, but produced nothing that I loved.

![preliminary redesigns](/content/images/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-11.28.19-AM.png)
![preliminary redesigns](/content/images/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-11.28.36-AM.png)
![preliminary redesigns](/content/images/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-11.28.52-AM.png)

Then just a few weeks ago, after doing a solid two or three days of nothing but writing. I got really engulfed into iA Writer’s font, **Nitti**. This led me to digging deep into [ia.net](http://ia.net) and then eventually to the [Nitti font’s website](https://www.boldmonday.com/typeface/nitti-grotesk/).

I got really into the idea of using a Grotesque sans-serif for body copy, even though I know for longer form writing it’s often better to use serifed fonts for readability’s sake.

I explored using FF Basic Gothic from [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-basic-gothic-web-pro) for a while and then my studio mate, [Mattox Shuler](http://fortfoundry.com), told me about [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans).

I went back and forth between **Basic Gothic** and **Work Sans** and ultimately went with the latter. <span style="color: red;">*</span>~~It’s got a slightly quirky personality with nice readability in body copy.~~ Plus I’m a sucker for a big fat heavy weight—the one I’m using for the headings.

<span style="color: red;">*</span>**Update: I changed my mind and starting using Georgia. Coincidentally my home state, and a nice readable serif that's stood the test of time.**

I *almost* didn't use Work Sans, because there's no true italics. I don't want the browser faux-italicizing the nice typeface, so for all instances of `<em>` I'm using a system font stack that defaults to...

`em { font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, "Open Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif; }`

...a technique I stole from [Medium](https://medium.design/system-shock-6b1dc6d6596f#.5movv5xvq).

I also used Mattox’s new monospace font [Native](https://fortfoundry.com/collections/fonts/products/native), as the small helper text sprinkled throughout the site.

Dealing with lots of typography elements like headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, and more is slow-going in design software, so I decided to jump straight into the browser and design with Sass for this next iteration.

Tweaking font families, sizes, weights, and styles is **much** more efficient in the browser than any other method.

Because of this, I began the new design by starting with the navigation. I tweaked and tweaked until it was working good across all sizes.

Then I jumped into the post detail view and styled as any elements as I could that I new would be in past or future posts.

Every other page beyond the post detail, is a slight variation of the same basic layout, so only minimal markup and style updates were necessary.

I finished most of the front-end code in just a few days. Funny how quickly you can power through work when you’re **really** into it.

Then I had to make a few more adjustments once I started chopping up the new code into a theme.

### Integrating with Ghost
This is the first development project I’ve tackled where I integrated the custom front-end code with the CMS all by myself.

It was a pretty smooth process overall and super fun. You’re supposed to have fun, right!?

### MDS Monday Mailer
Another thing I’ve been meaning to do is publish, publish, publish. I’ve given a half-assed attempt in the past with moderate success, but I’ve always wanted to **do more**.

So when I put this new version of the site together, I decided to commit publicly to producing new content every week and distribute through my email list.

The truth is… 

No one cares about me wanting to publish more and committing to sending something new every Monday, relatively speaking, and I totally respect that.

However, it’s still a pretty strong motivator to tell people you’re going to do something. At my core, I’m a very loyal person, so if I feel like I’m going to let someone down and it’s my fault, I will go great lengths to ensure that it doesn’t happen.

I also built the site with that sole purpose in mind. The form to sign up is on every page. That’s the goal, get people to sign up and deliver my very best for that audience.

It’s one of the most rewarding things for me to receive an email from someone whose letting me know how much I was able to help them along their path. Seriously, I can’t get enough of that. 

So, if you want in on the Monday goodness, scroll down and get on the list.

If email lists aren’t your thing, but you still wanna chat or get some questions answered or something like that, [please hit me up](http://mds.is/about/#contact). I’d be happy to help!

# People First, Money Second - A Tale of Two Chiropractors

![spine horse because](/content/images/2014/Jul/763px_Skeleton_with_outline_of_a_horse.png)

I've visited two chiropractors in the last year due to a weird pain in between my left shoulder blade and spine. The pain isn't unbearable - more like a subtle, annoying, someone standing too close to you while having a conversation, sort of pain. Not entirely debilitating, but you wish that it wasn't happening.

My experience with each chiropractor was completely different from the other. Let me explain.

## The First
The first chiropractor visit was a bit of a fluke. My wife bought us some cheap 1 hour massage coupons from a daily deal site. Something like *"$30 for a one-hour, full body massage and   chiropractic evaluation."* I know what you're thinking, red flag. I thought so too, but because of the weird little pain in my back I've had on and off for the last few years, I decided it was a good idea to get checked out.

I got to the office anticipating my magnificent mushy muscle, full-body massage. The receptionist was trying really hard to be super friendly, which came across as fake. I wrote my name and address on the 20 different pieces of paper she handed me and eventually got called back.

This guy, the chiropractor, looked like a retired body-builder, well-dressed in neat slacks and a tucked in polo, revealing his muscly frame. He stared hypnotically into my eyes as he informed of his process. I put on a gown-like shirt, got some things hooked up to my back to read the nerve connections between the vertebrae and the blah blah blah. All I could think is, "I'm ready for my massage."

After this he took me to another room and performed a manual evaluation. Of course he points out that my right shoulder hangs slightly lower than my left, I don't have equal range of motion in each of my hip joints, and few other things that I can't remember nor do I care about.

"I'm ready for my massage," I thought the myself quietly as I entertained a flood of overwhelming information about subfluxiation, vertebrae synapse connections, blah blah blah.

After this I finally got the massage - my sole reason for being there in the first place. I appreciated, to some degree, his attempt to inform me of the inner workings of the back, but it was all presented in a very medical type of way - generic, with little personality.

His message wasn't focused on me or my back problem, but he did manage to talk me into getting an "adjustment" that day - mostly because I was interested in seeing how it made my back feel.

To my ultimate disappointment, he had me sit in this medical-looking, computer-machine like chair while he used a tiny little pulsating hammer thing to align my vertebrae. I could barely feel anything happening at all as he maneuvered this puny device up and down my spine.

After a minute or two he said, "Alright, that's it. I know it doesn't feel like much is happening, but this little device is realigning your vertebrae. It will take several weeks of treatment for these adjustments to begin to hold in place." 

Utterly let down, he proceeded to pitch me on this 6-12 week plan for coming in 3-4 times per week for adjustments. I can't remember all the details, but the total price tag was around 3 to 4 grand. Somehow, in the moment he had me convinced and I scheduled my next appointment. I blame his hypnotic stare.

I came home and explained the surreal experience to my wife, who was about to go through the same thing in a few days.

>After logically thinking through everything, I came to my senses, called the office and cancelled everything.

## The First Recap
The experience the office created was based on earning more money - selling an attractive full-body massage with a small hook of a chiropractic evaluation. 

I went in for one thing and got a way different thing. The process was optimized for the business and not for me. I was shoved into a sales process and ultimately canceled everything.

## The Second
Nearly a year later, the same little annoying spot in my back began to hurt a little more. The pain flared up enough to cause more concern, then subsided after a few days. Deep down I knew that something was going on back there that should be fixed.

This time there was no free massage bait. I genuinely wanted to seek out a new chiropractor, despite my previous experience. A friend of mine that I witnessed having debilating back problems and then get fixed, gave me a recommendation.

I called, got an appointment, and visited within the week. The vibe was much more laid back. The receptionist was nice, there was less paperwork, and perhaps most importantly there was no pre-massage sales pitch. I was there for a specific thing.

I felt more comfortable because of the personal referral. I got called back by Meg, the second chiropractor character in the tale my spinal journey.

She began by asking me questions. "What's going on? Tell me about what you're experiencing. Where does it hurt?" Personal questions about me and my pain, without the intimidating and overwhelming vertebral knowledge bombs up front.

This is an important concept for nearly every service industry professional. Focus on the person first. What are their hopes, fears, and dreams? How do they seem emotionally? What are they thinking about?

She effortlessly asked me pointed questions while pushing and prodding on my back, in search of the painful problem. I tried to point out the exact spot, but she said "Don't worry, I'll find it.'

I laid face down on her table and within 30 seconds of rubbing around the area between my shoulder blade and spine, she said "Are you a musician or play any type of instrument?"

"I play guitar," I replied.

"Yep, guitar. That's what did this." she said without hesitation. "Really!?" I blurted out, as I couldn't hold back my surprise. "Yep, I work on a lot of guitar players, amateurs and professionals."

See, when you learn guitar, it's easy to start hunching over and tightening your back, shoulders, arms, hands, fingers, etc. Muscle tension can be a big deal. That's way the great guitar players look like the effortlessly glide up and down the fret board, because they are. 

![bb king](/content/images/2014/Jul/bbking.jpg)

Over the years I've gotten better about muscle tension, but I guess all of those 8 hour guitar sessions in college finally caught up to me.

She told me how the spot in my back was a tightened area of muscle, like a balled up fist that was putting pressure on the middle of my spine. She lined her fingers up with the center of my spine in between my shoulder blades and a bit lower with her other hand.

"See how the upper portion has shifted over? You've got a little scoliosis forming due to that irritated spot."

We talked some more and she proceeded to crack my back using a variety of techniques, none of which resembled the first chiropractors giant computer contraption. 

My chiropractor uneasiness was subsiding. "Maybe this isn't all a big hoax." I thought to myself. I felt genuinely better after being "adjusted" as they call it. She told me she'd like to do a follow up in a week to see how things looked and that we could take it from there.

>I setup an appointment the following week and walked away feeling relieved that this experience had been so much better than the first.

## The Second Recap
My experience at the second chiropractor was great. A friend referred me, there was no big sales pitch, and my problems were at the forefront of the conversations.

My hopes and fears were both addressed effortlessly by a combination of the chiropractor's experience and the questions she asked. She assured me that she only wanted to make people feel better and that if she couldn't help, she'd tell me, or refer me to someone else.

## Closing Thoughts
You can smell inauthenticity a mile away. There may be ways to mask what something really is with smoke and mirrors for a short while, but eventually the smoke will dissipate and the mirrors will get smudgy and cracked.

When you focus on people first, you're forced to listen to their  problems and their needs. Only *if* you can help them in some way, will you become valuable to them.

On the contrary, if you shove your product or service in someone's face and mask it with buzzwords and deep industry lingo, it smells bad and no one will want it.

# Photo Retouching Inspired by Gigantic Squid

I've done a fair amount of product and architectural photography over the years but haven't done much portrait work. I've got a solid knowledge of retouching and post production, so once I saw the Gigantic Squid photos (specifically the [Mackelmore](http://giganticsquid.com/portfolio/macklemore-artist-of-the-year/) ones), I decided that I **had** to take some portraits of my kids and give this style a go.

I moved my kitchen table, put a piece of tape on the floor, and bribed my kids with candy to let me take their photos, like any responsible adult would do. Their was *some* natural light coming through the window as well as a few tungsten lights on in the kitchen. 

It wasn't the most ideal environment for a shoot so I couldn't get a high aperture for a really sharp image, but it did satisfy my portrait photography hunger for the time being. There are still issues with color, etc., but I think they turned out pretty decent for a first quick stab. Have a look below for the after/before shots. 

## Justice
Justice trips me out. He always has the best facial expressions and cutest little smiles. Out of the 50+ shots of him I captured, this one felt the best to bring to full production.

![justice after](/content/images/2014/May/Justice_after.jpg)
![justice before](/content/images/2014/May/Justice_before-1.jpg)



## Justice and Isa
95% of the time, Justice and Isa are fighting or are in some sort of disagreement, mostly due to their close ages (currently 4 and 2). So it warms my heart when I can capture them like this. They were so giddy during the shoot, but near the end Justice had enough and started pushing Isa away. 

![justice and isa after](/content/images/2014/May/Justice_Isa_after_700.jpg)
![justice and isa before](/content/images/2014/May/Justice_Isa_before.jpg)
![justice pushing](/content/images/2014/May/Justice_pushing.jpg)

## Noah
Noah was pretty excited about his rubberband bracelet that neighbor had just given him, which is the blurry thing in the foreground. His go to camera face is similar to a [Chandler smile](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z3JNsOnmG-o/ThmJXV4tYQI/AAAAAAAAAv0/V5YczvAoUwM/s400/chandler+smile.jpg), so I had to do some work to get him to open up a bit. "Work" in this sense involves lots of phrases like *"cheeseboogers"* and *"stinky face,"* etc.

![noah after](/content/images/2014/May/Noah_after.jpg)
![noah before](/content/images/2014/May/Noah_before.jpg)

## Gigantic Squid
This all started last week when my friend, [Mattox](http://twitter.com/mattoxshuler), showed me [Gigantic Squid](http://giganticsquid.com)'s work. I was completely enamored. I've seen similar work from photography studios before, but something about seeing their before and after shots got me really intriqued. Getting a glimpse into someone's process is always a treat, like learning a magicians trick or learning how to recreate a tasty meal on your own.

# PI Law Firm Client Comm Application


Below is an edited version of the MVP document as I understand it.

### Problem
Unrealistic for Personal Injury Attorney to contact their 150+ clients once each week for a status update on their case. The clients are needy, call unexpectedly, and can disrupt an hour of working time.

This is the number one problem among case managers.

### Solution
Status update delivered via text and/or push notifications through the Needles Checklist API.

### Case Road Map
1. Incident
2. Treatment Phase
3. Case Road Map
4. Pre-demand Phase
5. Evidence Gathered
6. Demand Phase
7. Demand Sent
8. Negotiation Phase
9. Offer
10. Settlement Phase
11. Case Closed

---

- As a user, see progress reports of the claim status.
- As a user, see how many pieces of total evidence are required.
- As a user, see how many pieces of evidence that have been collected.
- As a user, see how many pieces of evidence that are uncollected.

### Treatment Phase

- As a user, be a able to collect and post evidence
- As a user, (maybe) post medical records (HIPAA reasons)
- As a user, post medical bills
- As a user, post incident report
- As a user, post photographs of vehicle damage
- As a user, post injury photos
- As a user, send text/voice messages
- As a user, request calls from paralegal, case manager, and/or attorney
- As a user, get notified about an offer and expect/schedule a call

### Calendar / Smart Scheduling

As an attorney, having clients who miss appointments result in lower damages, diminished case values, and lower fees.

- As a user, have medical provider schedule appointments for me.
- As a medical provider, potentially receive automated emails with a link to schedule appointments for user

### Demand and Settlement Phase

As an attorney, it’s difficult—and can be time intensive—to get “written authority” from clients in regards to offers and settlements.

- As a user, receive notifications of proposed demand amounts and settlement authorities.
- As a user, preview demand letters.
- As a user, able to approve demand letters.
- As a user, receive a proposed breakdown of settlement amounts
- As a user, approve a settlement by pressing a button
- As a user, send a message to describe an issue with the settlement.


### Notifications

As a designer, I propose thinking of these notifications in the following priority:

1. Text messages*
2. Emails*
3. Push notifications^

*Hyperlinks in messages that land on a website with the users’ information. Could also deep link to sections within a native mobile app.
^Links to a section in an app

---

## Design Proposal



###### Option 01
$3,000

Rapid prototype designed and developed over two days. Specific features and designs to be negotiated and finalized in the SOW. 

1. **Day One**
Ideal if we could schedule an in-person working session in Athens on the first day for a few hours. Remainder of day will be used for design.

2. **Day Two**
Finalize design and interactive prototype for delivery by end of day. We can do one round of light revisions, if necessary, after this day.

---

###### Option 02
$7,500

MDS will run a one-week design sprint with stakeholders to design for specific problems and challenges with the app. This would be more time intensive for everyone involved.

#### Sprint Days
1. **Monday** — Start at the end and agree on the goal. Map the challenges. Ask the experts (all involved) and pick a target.
2. **Tuesday** — Review existing ideas to remix and improve. Sketch and iterate with an emphasis on critical thinking. Begin planning Friday’s customer test by recruiting customers that fit your target profile.
3. **Wednesday** — Critique each solution and decide on which one has the best chance of achieving the long-term goal. Take the winning sketches and turn them into a storyboard, a step by step plan for the prototype.
4. **Thursday** – Create prototype—customer facing only. Also, make sure everything is ready for Friday’s test by confirming the schedule, reviewing the prototype, and writing and interview script.
5. **Friday** – Interview and learn by watching customers react to the prototype. This test makes the entire sprint worthwhile: At the end of the day, you’ll know how far you have to go, and you’ll know just what to do next.

We could potentially test with existing plaintiffs or other lawyer colleagues as potential customers.

# Plan to Fail

![bike](/content/images/2014/Jul/bike.jpg)

My family and I traveled to my in-laws for the fourth of July weekend. Unlike the cliche of this being a nightmarish experience, we very much look forward to heading down to Vidalia, GA and always have a great time.

To make my time even more enjoyable, I brought my [bike](http://mattdsmith.com/riding-again/) so I could go on a few rides while we were down. If you're anything like me, you'll pack some workout clothes in your bag when you travel even if you haven't worked out in months. Like somehow you'll magically make the time to hit the gym or go running because you're out of your normal rut.

When I bring my bike though, it's different. I look forward to riding it. I will strategically maneuver my day to account for an hour long bike ride instead of complaining that I don't have time. I use the excuse "I don't have time" for lots of things, but that's one of the fibbiest lines known to man. The truth is you don't *make* time. Big difference between the two as everyone *has* the same amount of time, it's just allocated differently by personal priority.

This was the first time that I brought my bike on a trip to the onion capital, so I didn't know which route would be the best to take when the time came to ride. I typically like to go 15-20 miles without too much road overlap. I studied a few possible routes on my phone and carefully plotted my course. According to my plan, it included some nice long country roads for a fairly low traffic ride.

## Keyword: Plan
Plans are necessary and vital for most projects, products, and general endeavors, but there is one common thread throughout nearly every plan. Change. Plans deviate slightly from the original and sometimes, they're thrown out completely when contradicting circumstances reveal themselves.

I was en route. Grinding down the asphalt with that euphoric feeling of being somewhere new and doing something different. I remembered my road route acronym as I pedaled off. GOTM -  Grossman, Oxley, Tap, Miracle. 

After the first set of planned roads were passed I came to my next leg, Jess Lane. This seemed like the perfect road to bypass the main highway, but when I got there, I realized my carefully crafted plan had failed me. 

Jess Lane wasn't much of a lane. It was more like a dirt and grass driveway that seemed to disappear into a cluster of country houses. Road bikes aren't equipped to handle that type of terrain, no matter how meticulous the original plan. 

I could've turned back, but I decided to keep going down the highway to look for the next paved country road allowing me to continue my zen-like ride. I was willing to stomach the occasional 18 wheeler zooming by, in search of my new clandestine path.

I got to the next road after a few more miles. It was dirt. "Crap." I had to turn around after all. By going so far down the main road, I accomplished my goal of riding 15+ miles within an hour, but it didn't look like my original plan.

A plan is merely a series of tactics that lead to an ultimate goal. They're a catalyst of set constraints that propel you forward by limiting choice. I was upset that things didn't go according to plan, but still accomplished my goal.

How many times do we fret over our plans? Our workout plan, meal plan, project plan. Plans are important, but can only account for so many things. You ultimately have to *do* the thing that you're planning for. Only by doing can you reveal the possible pitfalls. 

My plan for riding a specific route was thwarted, so I changed my plan mid-plan with a new plan. That failed and I changed again, but I still accomplished my goal.

I failed twice, but still succeeded. I can't help but ponder this concept as a much deeper metaphor for life's circumstances, both professionally and personally.

# How do you get that final design polish?

# 💅

Recently, someone emailed me this...

> "...I feel like what I’ve struggled with the most for the last couple of years is all around polish. I look at everything you put out and it just feels so sharp and polished. I feel like my process is so rushed these days that the “final final” designs just feel incomplete or not to my own satisfaction. So how do you do it? And do you have advice for getting great finished designs while working with a team of designers, PMs, and engineers?

Final polish is difficult to articulate and can rarely be boiled down to a step by step process. The best way to achieve final polish is to keep iterating over and over and over until it "just works." If you are unsure a certain visual element is fully polished, then it's very likely that it isn't.

This definitely gets easier with experience because you have YEARS of bad design decisions under your belt and you can more quickly spot what's going on. This still isn't a full substitute for iterating over and over until it's "magical."

Assuming your design includes a decent foundation of the three visual pillars—*typography*, *layout*, and *color*—you can then begin to iterate on your design to achieve a "style" that makes sense.

Is your design direction on point, or is the concept unclear? If you're not sure, you need to lock in how you want your design to feel.

Will it be fun and playful? Should it be modern and clean with a touch of hi-tech? Should it feel classy and modern with a bit of elegance? This is critical for allowing you to take your designs all the way to full polish, otherwise you'll spin your wheels endlessly in the first three pillars only without a clear direction to go above and beyond.

But it's important to note that you can't skip those three pillars either and go straight to direction. You can technically do them all simultaneously, but this takes practice and gets easier with experience.

Is your typeface usage AMAZING or does it feel so-so? If it doesn't feel very strong, then perhaps you need to tweak your sizes, spacing, line-height, weight, etc.

Is your layout REALLY strong, or does it feel a little disjointed? If it's not well-balanced and doesn't evoke a sense of harmony, then perhaps you need to line things up a little better, work within a better grid, look for places to create lines of continuation. Have you given EXTRA special attention to EVERY SINGLE PIECE of negative space in your layout? Or are there areas that have been overlooked. Double check your type alignment. Most of the time aligning your text to the baseline will produce the best results. This is where typography and layout begin to intersect. You have to get DEEP into the details of every single little tiny seemingly insignificant detail. This is what makes your design polished.

Do your colors look FANTASTIC or are they just kind of meh? If you haven't strategically chosen the HEX code or the HSB value of every single item on your screen, then you haven't completed one of the three pillars. Each color needs a strategy.

There must be a system. There must be a reason for every color. I'm not talking about a "design system" full of reusable components that exists for teams to build applications, though the spirit is similar.

I'm referring to a simple "mental system" of strategically choosing and using type sizes, font-weight, a specific alignment system, a system for determining negative space, margins, padding, borders, overall layout, and colors. This mental system should be used while you're designing and experimenting. You should view this system as a tiny evolving experiment that—while calculated and exact—constantly changes as you discern "yes or no" to your design micro-experiments.

Once you've gotten to a decent place with these three pillars, you can start to investigate the relationship between these elements.

Have you created enough layout connections to create a very noticeable balance between icons and text, images and body copy, and anything else that might live on your page?

To create polish, you MUST constantly pour over every little decision on the screen until you feel like it's magical. Sometimes you'll hit a roadblock and need outside perspective. Don't be naive to think that you must create the entire design to perfection without the input of others. 

Sure, I've created things that I believe to be great on my own, but oftentimes the best work comes when you get trusted feedback and critique.

These are the things I'm teaching in [Shift Nudge](https://shiftnudge.com).

# Pondering Meaning

After recently listening to [Tim Ferriss' interview with Pavel Tsatsouline](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/01/15/pavel-tsatsouline/), which is fantastic by the way, this quote from Pavel really stood out.

>"The brightest young people today, what do they end up doing? They end up designing apps. In the 50s and 60s they designed spaceships. The dreams were so much bigger."

This is a topic I'm still pondering intently, so I'll just leave this here without commentary until I can further clarify my thoughts.

# Pricing Design by Dan Mall

![pricing design book](/content/images/2016/01/book-pricing-design-1.svg)

I first learned about Dan Mall when he had just begun working with Big Spaceship in 2009. I remember being impressed with the content and quality of [his website](http://danielmall.com), which has remained roughly the same since then (with updated content, responsiveness, etc.) Kudos to him for keeping up with it so well.

In 2012, I met Dan in-person at an early [Greenville Grok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22jcfG8JcjY), when it was much smaller and more intimate of an event. I was in a session with him that evolved quickly with rapid white-boarding and *heated* group discussion (in a good way) about the nature of client work, project management, etc. Again super impressed with his knowledge and approach to work.

Our paths have crossed since then and I’ve even chatted with him a few times for teaching and speaking advice.

I write all of this as a precursor to the fact that Dan is a **very intelligent and kind person**. It shows with every interaction and I know that it bleeds into his client work, specifically the way he handles the topic of selling design.

If there’s one area that all designers and developers could get better at, it’s **pricing**. The psychology, the different approaches, why you shouldn’t shy away from money discussions, and much more.

I just finished reading his (brief) book from A Book Apart, [Pricing Design](http://abookapart.com/products/pricing-design), and whole-heartedly recommend you pick up a copy ASAP. It will only set you back a whopping $6, but if you implement the techniques he discusses, you’ll easily see a 1000x gain. I’m not exaggerating. 

This isn’t an affiliate link or anything, I just like Dan and his book that much. [Get it here from A Book Apart](http://abookapart.com/products/pricing-design).

# Priorities

[Father First](http://john.do/father-first/)

John Saddington:

>Making commitments to your business is hard. Making commitments to your family is even harder (and keeping them). Strange, isn’t it as you would think that it should be reversed.

As a father of [four](http://mattdsmith.com/four), I can so relate to this. It's a constant struggle to keep family as a priority over work and everything else. I have discussions with my wife quite often about this concept and there's no "one-time" answer to end the question once and for all. As a full-time stay at home mom, she's on the opposite end of this spectrum and provides the much needed counter-balance to my independence as a business owner. It's a continual, puzzling tension that demands to be addressed, tended to, and solved. 

The puzzle changes - sometimes monthly, sometimes daily. It's my job to decide when and where my time gets spent, with the great and invaluable counsel from my wife and kids.

It's so so hard to become selfless, and stay that way, but it's so rewarding and so freeing.

There's a really great video that [John](http://john.do/father-first/) posted on his blog that hits on this subject. You can watch it below.

I try to have at least 2 books going at a time. One I can listen to via Audible and another hard copy I can read at night before bed.

This doesn't always happen, but I'm doing my best when I'm filling my mind with a good book while driving or working out.

*All books are Amazon affiliate links.*

To create this page, I redrew a simplified version of the book covers in Illustrator. Then I got a starting point for the *book flip* `code` from [here](https://codepen.io/sirnightowl/pen/Gemua).

Chrome seems to render pretty nicely, but there's a small amount of wonkiness with the transitions in Firefox and Safari so if you know of a way to optimize it, I'm all ears. Enjoy!

# Rec's

[Revising Prose](https://amzn.to/2TZ2fcE) is a great book to help you learn to write better. This will help you with emails, documentation, writing user journeys, writing use interface copy and more. Highly recommended.

[How to Make Sense of Any Mess](https://amzn.to/3gt7pVK) is a great book when it comes to the fundamentals organizing information. Information Architecture is a critical skill when it comes to design great products.

Any book that deals with human psychology is going to provide valuable information about what motivates people, how they think, why they do what they do, etc. Here are few that I would loosely put in this category and are great books: [Influence](https://amzn.to/35afslk), [Power of Habit](https://amzn.to/3wffzrs), [Thanks for the Feedback](https://amzn.to/3ge1LIp), [Grit](https://amzn.to/2RIJNnT), [The War of Art](https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Winning-Creative-Battle-audio-cd/dp/1501260626), [Mindless Eating](https://www.amazon.com/Mindless-Eating-More-Than-Think-ebook/dp/B000MAHC0E), and probably lots more that I'm forgetting.

Hopefully those will keep you busy for awhile. =)

# Home Studio Setup

My audio/visual journey began officially [back in 2014](http://mds.is/buying-audio-equipment/) when I decided to produce my first online video course. I started with some better audio and used my webcam. Then in [2017](http://mds.is/shooting-video/), I decided to up my video game with a proper camera. 

Since then I've experimented with [custom built audio booths](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mdsbox/), [full studio rooms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MODGsGSYINg), and lots of other little various things here and there—always researching and experimenting. It can be quite time-consuming and expensive after a while, so hopefully this may inform you a little more if you're in the market too.


---

#### Lighting
Lighting is probably the most important part of getting good video. If you don't have budget for lights, sit beside a window.

- [Aputure 120dii for key light](https://amzn.to/2Sho5Vd)
- [Aputure mini light dome ii for a diffuser](https://amzn.to/2XVJJ4R)
- [Manfrotto 1004BAC Master Stand to hold the lights up](https://amzn.to/34XrlKt)
- [Aputure MC RGBWW for a small bg fill light](https://amzn.to/2VQcY6y)

#### Background
Backgrounds can be distracting and I like black, so I went for a simple backdrop. 

- [Savage Seamless Background Paper - #20 Black (107" x 36') for my backdrop](https://amzn.to/2VP5WyV)
- [Manfrotto 059WM Wall Mount Single Background Holder (to hold up the backdrop)](https://amzn.to/2VtAib4)

#### Video
I haven't tried that many cameras, but I really love my Sony a6400. It's small, shoots 4k, and the flip out screen is perfect for framing when doing tutorials and such.

- [Sony a6400 for my main camera](https://amzn.to/3cFeKhn)
- [Power cord for the camera so I don't need to use batteries](https://amzn.to/3cASpBE)
- [Sigma 16mm f/1.4 prime lens for really nice depth of field and buttery low ISO shooting](https://amzn.to/3byFGzg)
- Sometimes I put my camera on the floor with a tripod, but lately loving having it on a [Røde PSA Boom Arm](https://amzn.to/3axveqH)
- [Elgato Cam Link](https://amzn.to/2ShpFX9) for using my a6400 with Screenflow or Loom videos (turns your nice camera into a webcam)
- External HDs because video storage is very real. This is my current favorite: [Oyen Digital U32 Shadow 4TB SSD](https://amzn.to/3eKvoOM)

#### Audio
I've experimented with 4-5 mics. Definitely like my current Røde setup, but if you're on a cheaper budget[ this mic ](http://mds.is/buying-audio-equipment/)is really solid quality for the price.

- [Rode Procaster Dynamic Mic (dynamic mics cut bg noise better than condenser mics, hey kids!)](https://amzn.to/3cHUv2N)
- [Focusrite Scarlett Solo USB Audio Interface (XLR to USB-C)](https://amzn.to/2yEnkhE)
- [Cloudlifter adapter to get higher audio levels](https://amzn.to/34Y5wud)
- [Røde PSA Boom Arm](https://amzn.to/3axveqH)

#### Software
If you were going to go with only one piece of software for tutorials, I'd go with Screenflow. It's super versatile and allows simple edits. I use Final Cut to have more control over my 4k face cam video and editing workflow, but this is definitely not needed to get started. My first tutorials were webcam and screenflow only.

- [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) for screen recording and light editing 
- [Final Cut](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?app=tv&ign-itscg=20200&ign-itsct=rv_FCP_google&mt=12&mttnagencyid=2433&mttncc=US&mttnpid=305109&mttnsiteid=141192&mttnsub1=192e0771a2854df68f15d92498ae1dbd-gl&mttnsub2=c-1751245399-ag-72969238714-ad-381772340323-k-kwd-295738069322&mttnsubad=72969238714&mttnsubsite=AppleFinalCutPro) for final video editing
- [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is great for quick unedited videos

# Refine

Spiderman didn't start off in his [fancy suit](http://mds.io/XMrU), he started in [jogging pants and a ski mask](http://comicstheblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/spiderman112.jpg).

[Basecamp](http://basecamp.com) started without an automated payment system.

[Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com) started as an email list.

Whatever you are thinking about pursuing or creating, start small, start humble, and do the hard work first.

Don't try to design an amazing crime-fighting costume, fret over the material or the logo on the chestplate, before you start fighting actual crime. Grab your sweats and mask and start looking for injustice!

Otherwise, you may find out after 6-12 months of design (guilty!) that you actually don't care for crimefighting afterall.

The best projects I've created or have been a part of have started small - designed, developed, and later refined through a beautiful mix of code and design together.

# Super Quick Resizing in Sketch

I wanna show you a sweet little speed maneuver in Sketch that helps you massage the details of your UI while going fast.

**TL;DW** 

1. Select an object
2. Hold down `cmd + shift + arrow key` to quickly resize 10px at a time
3. Let go of `shift` to resize 1px at a time
4. Profit!

# Richard Sachs

![richard sachs](/content/images/2014/Sep/torch.jpg)

[Richard Sachs](http://www.richardsachs.com/site/about/) has been building bicycle frames since 1972. He's a one-man shop, sells custome-made frames starting at $4k, and has a seven year waiting list.

From his [website](http://www.richardsachs.com/site/about/):

>"I firmly believe that my high standards have been a bit easier to achieve because I do work alone. I have no apprentice and employ no outside help, either in my workroom, or in the form of subcontractors. From beginning to end, I do it all. And that includes answering the telephone. If you want to know more about my bicycle frames and how they are made … if you have a question about frame design or construction, proper fit, acceptable alignment, tolerances … anything at all, call me. I will be the one answering your call, and I would be very pleased to tell you more."

For 42 years Mr. Sachs has been building bike frames. 42 years! When I read about people like this and Jiro Ono, the [guy who dreams of sushi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/), dedicating their entire lives to a single craft - it's perplexing, inspiring, and frightening.

My mind painfully unfolds. Should I do something like that? Could I?

In 2013, [House Industries](http://www.houseind.com) rebranded Richard Sachs and the [results](http://www.houseind.com/showandtell/2013/09/13/HouseIndustriesforRichardSachs) were mindblowing.

# I Started Riding a Bike Again

I just bought a [commuter bike](http://mds.io/QyAg) for the five and a half mile trek between my house and office. With a wife and 3 kids, making time to work out can be quite challenging, so commuting on a bike is my newest attempt to get the blood pumping. I just simply can’t listen to Tony Hortman’s jokes on P90X anymore.

When I was a kid, riding my bike was a critical part of my life. It’s how I got to my friends’ house, pretended to be a professional stuntman, and most importantly how I made my way to the gas station so I could [get candy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sYA4Xnu7YI).

I spent the better part of my pre-driving life pedaling my bike all over the place. Man, I’ll never forget the those days riding with friends, building ramps from cinder blocks and plywood, and lighting the occasional random thing on fire. 

Now that I’m back on a bike after 15+ years of non-biking, those childhood feelings and memories are rushing back during my rides. Timing street crossings just right, learning shortcuts and backroads through the town, and the sense of adventure and accomplishment that comes from your heart racing and legs burning.

The journey is as fun as the destination. Knowing that you’re pushing for a goal and maneuvering for an end result is satisfying by itself. When you’re riding a bike from point A to point B, you know that you WILL get there, it’s just a matter of continuing to pedal and to keep pushing. Keep going. Take a break sure, but you start up again and have fun along the way. Jump curbs, dodge traffic, feel the fresh air hit your face as you bomb the downhills. These things are all part of “getting there.” This is the fun part. Aching muscles and all.

And now as I ride I keep thinking of this metaphor. Life is a journey. You will never stop pedaling. It’s not so bad if your legs start to burn, in fact it’s good for you. Don’t focus on your legs burning, focus on pushing through and preparing for the downhill. Next time your legs will be stronger. And the next time, stronger still. 

Keep moving!

# I Ran A Half Marathon

My feet hurt. My legs are sore and my joints ache. I'm in pain, but I'm smiling.

Last weekend, I finished my first ever half marathon (13.1 miles) and I gotta say, I’m feeling pretty fantastic. Here’s a picture my wife snapped of me and the kids after I crossed the finish line.

<figure><img alt="me with my 4 kids" src="/content/images/2016/10/mds-post-athhalf.jpg" /><figcaption>Yes, that is a cutoff sleeve on my head. Keepin' it classy, ya'll!</figcaption></figure>

I always like to connect personal experiences to meaningful metaphors I can draw from later and this race is no different.

In July of this year I **decided** (key word) I wanted to run the AthHalf, an annual half marathon in my hometown of Athens, GA. I’ve never been a runner per se, but this seemed like a good challenge with a deadline to boot. Something to work towards and to motivate me.

After talking with some runner friends and googling around for half marathon training programs, I got started with my official training in July. That provided a little more than 12 weeks before the big day. 

There were so many times during training where I missed runs and messed up my schedule, but I’d always try to course correct to stay on track.

A week before the race I ran the course as my last “long run” of my training program. After a grueling time of nearly 2 hours, my solo practice pace averaged at `8:53` per mile for a total run of `1:56`.

Fast forward to race day, add in live music at every other mile marker, a slew of fans cheering on runners, and it created quite the energetic atmosphere. I stayed slightly faster than my previous time, but after mile 8 I decided to get out of my comfort zone. 

I cranked up my pace by nearly a minute and felt great. In retrospect, I probably could’ve increased my pace earlier.

For my current level of fitness, eight miles is usually the point where I naturally start to get pretty exhausted. During the race this was no different, but something switched mentally.

This moment was what I had been training for. I **decided** (again, keyword) I’d put in more effort than my body wanted to deliver... until I hit the finish line.

It was during that hardest time of the race where I pushed myself the most and went the fastest. Check out the splits below and you can see where I picked it up.

![Strava stats](/content/images/2016/10/IMG_4810.PNG)

I finished the race with a total time of `1:45`, ten minutes faster than the week before. You can [see the full stats on my Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/activities/739311933).

I can’t help but believe this race is not some silo-ed event in my life. I believe this training and personal victory will spill over into my family, my relationship with my wife and kids, and even my work.

It’s a nice reminder when things feel the most overwhelming, it’s often because you’re getting close to the finish line. If you can just bare down and press harder, you’ll get farther and go faster than you ever thought possible.

Some parting thoughts...

What have you **decided** to do even though you feel unequipped? Do you have a strong *why*? Do you have a *goal*, a *deadline*, and a *plan*?

# Scooters & Constraints

We bought all of our kids some kickboard scooters for christmas. If you've never seen them, they're much different than the previously popular razor scooters. The kickboards feature a neat two-wheel front swivel suspension with one wheel in the back. It's more like carving rather than leaning and turning with a traditional scooter.

The gifts were a hit. I'd go outside with them, sip my coffee and watch as they'd scoot up and down the driveway as fast as they could, bombing over acorns, leaves, and sticks just before whipping it into the garage. That actually sounds dangerous for my 2 year old. I should probably clean that off better before hand. There's something oddly soothing about the sound of polyurethane wheels grinding into the rough concrete driveway.

As fun as it is for them, this scooting only lasts a couple of minutes. After a few quick 30 yard runs down from the road to our garage, something about the initial appeal wore off for them. They wanted to break out some other toy or go jump on the trampoline, with their helmets still on.

But I wanted to see them really understand how they could carve back and forth with these scooters. They really do have a cool suspension and turning mechanism. I thought they'd continue to experiment with a few gentle nudges from dear old dad. I was wrong.

Suddenly, the cold air hit my face. I took another sip of coffee and saw a bin of sidewalk chalk in the corner of my garage along with some other crap that I've been meaning to clean up. I grabbed a piece and decided to draw them a path on the driveway. I started with a straight line and slowly added back and forth curves. The dust from the oversized chalk blew away in the wind as I admired the chalky grind into the harsh surface.

I made for them a large line to follow up and down the driveway. One that would show them how to carve left and right, make big sweeping turns, etc. They were instantly re-engaged and I started thinking about how easy it was to simply make that chalk  path for them. I had a goal for them, made an easy path, provided instructions, and watched it unfold according to plan. 

Before, they had complete freedom to do whatever they wanted but they didn't take full advantage of it. They needed constraints, boundaries and direction. This is such a great metaphor for life, business, and design.

I remember early in 2012 I was incredibly busy with work. I was juggling 3 or 4 projects simultaneously, one alone required a full 40 hours per week. Oddly enough, this was the time of year when I was the most productive in my personal time with reading, praying, working out, etc. I had so much to do in each day that I **HAD** to go to bed on time. And if I didn't wake up at 5AM I would have no time to myself. These constraints on my life at the time, much like the chalk path for my kids, created an environment for me to be successful in ways that I hadn't been before. For years I've wanted to be able to wake up at 5AM and have several hours to myself before the day started, but it has been, (and still is) a constant struggle. 

While I appreciate that being super busy with projects helped me in other areas of my life (eg. time management), I'd like to find ways to draw my own 'chalk path' instead of be forced into it by loads of work. 

One of my goals for this year is to write a minimum of 250 words per day and so far, 1.5 weeks into 2013, I'm tracking at about a 50% success rate. Good but not great. I have a handful of other goals but haven't gotten specific enough to create a solid path. "Should I go running in the morning or in the evening?" is something I've been asking myself nearly everyday.

I've been so busy with indecisiveness (ie. lack of a path) that I've only managed to go running once in the past week. I'm going to experiment with setting a specific time for each task I want to accomplish for the day and see if that yields better results. I've done this so many times before but I feel like I'm closer to actually creating a habit now.

# The Secret to Happiness

The story below is an excerpt from [The Alchemist](/reading).

---

*A merchant sent his son to learn the Secret of Happiness from the wisest of men. The young man wandered through the desert for forty days until he reached a beautiful castle at the top of a mountain. There lived the sage that the young man was looking for.*

*However, instead of finding a holy man, our hero entered a room and saw a great deal of activity; merchants coming and going, people chatting in the corners, a small orchestra playing sweet melodies, and there was a table laden with the most delectable dishes of that part of the world.*

*The wise man talked to everybody, and the young man had to wait for two hours until it was time for his audience.*

*The Sage listened attentively to the reason for the boy’s visit, but told him that at that moment he did not have the time to explain to him the Secret of Happiness.*

*He suggested that the young man take a stroll around his palace and come back in two hours’ time.*

*“However, I want to ask you a favor,” he added, handling the boy a teaspoon, in which he poured two drops of oil. “While you walk, carry this spoon and don’t let the oil spill.”*

*The young man began to climb up and down the palace staircases, always keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon. At the end of two hours he returned to the presence of the wise man.*

*“So,” asked the sage, “did you see the Persian tapestries hanging in my dining room? Did you see the garden that the Master of Gardeners took ten years to create? Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library?”*

*Embarrassed, the young man confessed that he had seen nothing. His only concern was not to spill the drops of oil that the wise man had entrusted to him.*

*“So, go back and see the wonders of my world,” said the wise man. “You can’t trust a man if you don’t know his house.”*

*Now more at ease, the young man took the spoon and strolled again through the palace, this time paying attention to all the works of art that hung from the ceiling and walls.*

*He saw the gardens, the mountains all around the palace, the delicacy of the flowers, the taste with which each work of art was placed in its niche. Returning to the sage, he reported in detail all that he had seen.*

*“But where are the two drops of oil that I entrusted to you?” asked the sage.*

*Looking down at the spoon, the young man realized that he had spilled the oil.*

*“Well, that is the only advice I have to give you,” said the sage of sages.*

*“The Secret of Happiness lies in looking at all the wonders of the world and never forgetting the two drops of oil in the spoon.”*

---

I read The Alchemist earlier this year and have recently begun reading it to my two oldest boys as a fun bedtime story. 

Though I'm sure a lot of the core principles of the stories maybe somewhat lost on them, I hope nuggets of wisdom like the one above sticks with them.

What are the drops of oil in your life?

What are the critical few things you need to take care of at the same time you pursue and enjoy new things?

# Create a Settings Icon in Illustrator CC

![settings icon](/content/images/2014/Jun/settings_icon.png)

Lots of times, I will create icons like this on the fly, while designing interfaces in Photoshop. However, it's generally a good idea to keep these as separate assets in the event you want to do anything else with them.

Creating icons in Illustrator gives you more flexibility for your final output. You can paste them as shape layers into Photoshop, Sketch, etc. or use them directly in Illustrator for wireframing, interface design, or even print.

In the video below, you can see each step for creating a *settings* icon in Adobe Illustrator CC.

*Side note: This is the first test video produced with my new [audio equipment](http://mattdsmith.com/audio-equipment/). I'm pretty pleased with the setup and quality so far, although I need to give the audio a bump up next time.*

`Edit > Transform > Transform Again`

As a general rule, I try to create most icons by joining together basic shapes like circles, rectangles, etc. There are limits to this technique, but it serves as a great place to get started.

# Simple Complex Shapes in Illustrator

![shield shape](/content/images/2015/01/shield.png)

Twitter friend, [Mike](http://twitter.com/mikebeecham), created a shield-like shape (below) in Illustrator and had some issues when scaling it down. The shape was built with multiple polygons that all aligned beside each other to form the final mark. The *seam* in between the individual shapes caused the issue. Even though the vector paths were touching, the background color pierced through where the shapes met.

![mike's shape](/content/images/2015/01/mBZnVKN1ykqK3f0z8rvaE_3Q-qmkEDzVO0Aj9v6pF3s.png)

To correct this issue, we need a solid background shape and a few less individual shapes, ultimately producing fewer seams. Take a look at how to fix we can fix this issue in the video below.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/4WX5bc-_9N8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Voila, no seams!

![no seams](/content/images/2015/01/no-seams-01.png)

After sending the video to Mike via Twitter, [David](http://twitter.com/davekova) jumped in and **blew my mind** showing us the [Shape Builder tool](http://kova.me/1aXfI). I'll definitely be adding that to my Illustrator arsenal, as should you.

# How to Create a Simple Illustration in Illustrator

![vessel](/content/images/2014/12/vessel.png)

I'm working on some wireframes for a client who builds large vessels and rather than use the standard grey box with the "X" in it to represent every image, I thought it would be fun to do a quick little abstract vessel illustration to give the wireframes a little more interest.

Creating a spot illustration like this is super simple with Illustrator. You can begin by drawing shapes on top of a reference photo and continue to modify the points with the direct select tool `A` to create the angles and what not. 

Watch the video below to see the steps that go into creating something like this in a little over 5 minutes.

# Photoshop is Sketch's Daddy

The more I use Sketch for interface design, the more I like it, but it also makes me appreciate how awesome Photoshop is. You just can't beat Photoshop for image editing - sizing, cropping, compositing, etc. and that's not even half of its capabilities. 

>Photoshop was created in 1988.

For you non-math whizzes, that's 26 years ago. It's gone through countless versions, changes, bug fixes, etc. and has continued to evolve with the design industry time and time again. It's not going anywhere anytime soon.

>Sketch was created in 2010.

Sketch is 4. At 26, Photoshop is old enough to be Sketch's daddy. I've really enjoyed using Sketch for interface design, specifically for iOS apps, but designing image heavy websites in Sketch, in my experience, can be a little frustating.

With Photoshop I seamlessly go in between image editing, typesetting, and UI design for a marketing site, but with Sketch, it's more difficult to do that.

I'm not knocking Sketch, I really do love it, but I know that Photoshop is a vital tool for my job. And tools don't normally kill other tools, they compliment each other. Like a cordless drill and a screw driver, a mitre saw and a circular saw. 

It's great to have such awesome selections of software to work with on a day to day basis. I gladly welcome Sketch to come hang out with, but not replace, its UI father, Photoshop.

# Hot Take on Slack's New Logo

---

**Warning: Unsolicited hot take on a logo redesign.**

---

Don't you just hate hot-takes without context and constraints of what the design team or designers were up against. Pushing vector points, presenting concepts, convincing stakeholders, etc... all of these are why hot-takes aren't very productive, yet here we are...

All in all, I totally dig the collateral and the patterns that have come out of [Slack's logo update](https://slackhq.com/say-hello-new-logo?cvosrc=spredfast.twitter.brand&cvo_creative=sf97658134&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=spredfast&utm_content=sf97658134&utm_campaign=a_spredfast_twitter_all_en_follower_engagement_sf97658134_20190116&sf97658134=1). All of the stuff on [Pentagram's](https://www.pentagram.com/work/slack) site looks really nice—the [bus stop panel](https://pentagram-production.imgix.net/618d5092-a542-4dae-bd27-a3afb4bcc12d/mb_slack_07.jpg?w=1500&crop=1&fm=jpg&q=70&auto=format&fit=crop&h=1000) and [the magazine layout, especially](https://pentagram-production.imgix.net/618d5092-a542-4dae-bd27-a3afb4bcc12d/mb_slack_10.jpg?w=740&fm=jpg&q=70&auto=format).

But the logo mark itself feels... too busy? I'm not sure yet. Maybe it's perfect. I've literally only seen it for a few minutes at this point. But I couldn't help myself. So I did [this](https://twitter.com/mds/status/1085627529359179776).

*Perhaps it's the extra detail of the tiny speech bubbles?*<br/>
*Maybe I just miss the 4 bars?*<br/>
*Maybe there could even be a simpler version?*
![slack logo hottake redesign](/content/images/2019/01/slack.png)


Anyways, props to the Pentagram, Michael Bierut, and the people making decisions at Slack. They're all way more informed and experienced on this matter than myself.

Bravo for making a change and putting it out there.

I'm always fascinated by my complete ignorance of *time* when it comes to my own projects. For client work I'm always careful to account for plenty of time for each phase of a project: planning and research, wireframing (when necessary), conceptual design, production design, and development.

Yet, when it comes to my own projects like a site redesign or an app, I'm quick to jump right into Photoshop or Sublime to start hammering things out. Somehow I trick myself into thinking that the other steps aren't necessary for my own work but then feel depressed that I haven't created something amazing and original after 30 minutes of time spent.

I'm reminded constantly by my own ignorance that quality work takes time. In my own mind I think to myself, "Just make it awesome, something simple, without spending too much time on it." And we all know that you can [only pick two of those three things](http://kottke.org/05/04/pick-two).

If I, as a professional designer who is painfully aware of the intricacies of this line of work, fall victim to this mindset of "good, fast, and cheap," how much more do I need to remind clients, investors, team members, managers, and more? Perhaps you've thought like this too?

Here's the bottom line: **quality work takes time**. Period. This will look different for each project, but there is no denying this universal truth. If you want something produced with a high level of craftsmanship, you're going to have to roll you sleeves up and get busy doing the hard work.

Slow down so you can speed up.

# Solving the Cube

![rubik's cube](/content/images/2016/07/image.jpeg)

---

>“If you are curious, you’ll find the puzzles around you. If you are determined, you will solve them.” – Erno Rubik

---

My son handed me a Rubik’s cube and said, “Can you solve this?” Suddenly, all of those childhood memories of crushing defeat came rushing back.

“Ughhh,” I thought to myself. I remember as a kid taking apart the cube and putting it back together was the only way I could “solve” the annoying puzzle.

**I decided that night that I would learn to solve the Rubik’s cube.**

Deciding is often the most difficult part of any task. Deciding to do the thing and then continuing to make the same decision over and over until the thing is done.

I searched `how to solve the Rubik’s cube` late that night and stayed up until 3 in the morning learning various algorithms based on the [CFOP method](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/advanced-cfop-fridrich/). I got about 80% of the way there, but it got too late and my brain was mush.

The next day I showed my kids my new found 80% solving capabilities. Not good enough. They weren’t satisfied.

I spent the next day, maybe two, learning more about the last few algorithms and why they worked. Also “how” they worked. I started to understand them more than just random strings of `R, U, R’, U, R, U, U, R’` and the like.

The more I practiced, the easier it became. I’m pleased to say that I can now defeat any unsolved Rubik’s cube that comes my way—assuming it’s the 3x3x3 variety.

1. Solve the white cross
2. Solve the the white corners.
3. Solve the first two layers.
4. Orient the yellow cross.
5. Position the yellow corners.
6. Redeem your childhood defeat.

~~My best time so far is a measly 3:55. Maybe I'll keep going for a sub minute solve...~~

**Update: As of January 1, 2017, [my fastest speed is 55.617 seconds](https://twitter.com/mds/status/816480026984071169).** ⚡️

## More Than Just a Puzzle
I like to explore metaphors and connections whenever possible and this Rubik’s Cube is a great one for goal setting.

When you set a goal it needs to be specific and there needs to be a strong “why” to keep you motivated. Most goals also need smart goals along the way. Smaller goals within the large goal that keep you on path. Like little checkpoints. 

**Celebrate the checkpoints**. There tiny accomplishments that confirm you’re on the right track.

It’s empowering to solve the first step correctly. The same way it’s empowering to hit the first checkpoint on any goal. Same goes for the other checkpoints. If everything is small and bite-sized along the way, it’s manageable.

If you’re only goal is “Solve the Rubik’s Cube,” that’s not going to be very helpful.

You need a big goal and smaller smart goals along the way. And don’t forget your “why.” That’s gonna keep you motivated.

I wanted to impress my kids AND teach them how to solve the cube as well. I also wanted to prove to myself that I could learn it. A valuable teaching moment in the works. That was my "why."

~~My kids haven’t quite gotten it just yet, but they can get up to **Step 2**. They know they’re on the right track, and know the next step. Is it hard? Kind of, but at least it’s clear what needs to be done.~~

**Update: Both my 9 year old (57 secs) and 6 year old (under 2 mins) can solve the cube.**

It’s said that only 6% of the population knows how to solve a Rubik’s cube. **If it was easy everyone would do it**.

## Fun Facts
- As of this writing, Lucas Etter from Kentucky, set the 2015 world record at age 14 for solving a Rubik’s Cube in **4.90 seconds**.
- There are over **43 quintillion** (43,252,003,274,489,856,000) possible arrangements of the puzzle pieces in a Rubik’s Cube.
- **Erno Rubik** created the Rubik’s cube in 1974 while trying to solve the structural problem of moving parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart. He did not realize that he had created a puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried to restore it. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube).

I ordered several cubes from Amazon for me and my kids. [This one is my favorite](http://amzn.to/29Och7A) if you’re feeling inspired to grab one for yourself. Only $7.

# Squarespace Logo

![squarespace logo](/content/images/2014/Jan/squarespace_logo.png)

Yesterday Squarespace released a new product, [Squarespace logo](http://squarespace.com/logo) and my Twitter feed was blowing up about it. Some people were *"extremely disappointed"* and others *"expected more from Squarespace."*

Before I dive into the implications and interpretations of the site. Have you actually looked at [it](http://squarespace.com/logo) and played around with it? It's very well designed and works amazingly well. It's like an extremely watered down version of Adobe Illustrator in the browser. The design and user experience alone is impressive in my book and I applaud the team that put it together. Job well done.

I mean come on, there are actual people that worked on that thing day after day after day, designing, coding, tweaking, and on and on. To immediately poo poo on it the day it comes with a gut reaction based on your personal worldview is a bit trite.

The fact is, Squarespace makes off the shelf website templates for people to use. The quality is high and the service is quite nice. I've never deployed any website with it, but have tinkered around with it a few times. There are even a few really good designers that are using a prebuilt Squarespace template for their own site. Good for them, they look great.

I don't hear anyone complaining about that? Is there a fundamental problem with using an off the shelf website template? I say no. In fact the very site you are reading right now (at the time of this original post) is using the default theme for Ghost, called casper. And I'm a designer!? The travesty! How is selling a pre-made website template any different than selling a pre-made logo?

Now for some reason, if that same concept trickles over into "logo design" it becomes a big deal to lots of people. I  can easily argue both sides of the coin. I can easily make fun of people who use Squarespace Logo, but what good does that do? What is the motive behind that? I don't need to do that in order to justify myself as a designer and neither should you. I believe that if you are truly and deeply bothered by Squarespace Logo, then perhaps you are threatened that there is a now a plug and play identity builder, which has the potential to render your services obsolete. 

Were all web designers rendered obsolete when the advent of prebuilt themes came out? Is it now impossible to get a job in the field of web design. Poppycock. The thriving theme market just goes to show you how much of a demand there is in our industry.

*When ~~Crocs (I whiffed on my original analogy)~~ [Toms](http://www.toms.com) shoes came out it didn't take long for there to be a cheaper alternative called [Bobs](http://www.bobsfromskechers.com). Did this render Toms obsolete?**

No, it further validated the success they were having. But if you go into a store and test the materials, comfort and fit for yourself, you can tell the difference in the two products. Bobs feel cheaper than Toms, because they are. But for some people cost is the number one thing to be concerned about so they go for Bobs.

That's the same reason people use Squarespace themes, among others. It's not expensive, relative to a professional designer's services, and it's also very easy. There is a market for it. Not everyone can afford to pay thousands of dollars on a custom logo or website. As a matter of fact, I can't afford to hire myself to design a custom personal website. Mostly because I'm a horrible client. I don't know what I want, I change my mind often. So I choose a default Ghost theme for now, with a few minor modifications.

The same principals apply to Squarespace logo. There is a group of people that are starting businesses, products etc., that need something to get started. They have a budget of $100, $50, $25. 99% of the time I can't help people like that because I have my own set of needs that need to be met by charging clients my full market rate. Shall I tell these people to go make their own logo in Microsoft Word with Comic Sans, so all of my friends and I can make fun of them later? It's tempting, but that's not my style.

I would much rather see nice icons, designed by professional designers contributing to the noun project, used in the general public as opposed to another sad Papyrus logo with a swoosh through the middle. 

**I literally have no idea why the Toms/Bobs comparison popped into my head. It's not a great analogy, so feel free to use your own metaphor here. Be creative!*

# Are Float Labels Really That Problematic After All?

This is a response to Adam Silver's May 25, 2017 piece entitled [Floating Labels Are Problematic](https://medium.com/simple-human/floating-labels-are-a-bad-idea-82edb64220f6).

As the guy who [made the original design](http://floatlabel.com) that the majority of the *Float Label* craze was based on, I feel somewhat obligated to share my perspective on the matter.

![float label pattern](http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6410/screenshots/1254439/form-animation-_gif_.gif)

I need to preface this by saying, I've never met Adam, but have read some of his other [articles](https://medium.com/@adambsilver) and I really appreciate and admire his thoughtfulness of tiny details, like whether or not a button should have an arrow or a hand cursor. 

Adam makes a lot of great points in his article and in certain contexts, I would agree.

I believe however, that it's important to call out some subtle *absolute* statements in the article and point out that they're actually *relative* based on design at large, rather than the individual pattern of a floating label.

I also want to hedge all of this by saying that I don't believe float labels should be used for every form ever made. If you don't think they add value to your form, don't use them. Ok? 

If you've tested one way versus the other, use the higher performing method. Who doesn't want higher conversion rates?

But just remember, **a form alone isn't going to boost conversion rates through the roof**.

You have to create enough value and solve a big enough problem with your content so a user is actually motivated to use your form in the first place.

I myself have done no official float label split testing and can't confidently recommend the pattern over a standard label, based on pure research alone.

But I can say that I recently used float labels on my [Intro to Icon Design](http://introtoicons.com) course form and **saw a conversion rate of over 30%**. According to [my quick research](https://sumo.com/stories/email-signup-benchmarks), that's 10 times higher than the average opt in form that generates only 3% conversions.

![aiux sign up](/content/images/2017/06/aiux-signup.gif)

Would the conversion rates been higher had I not used float labels? My gut says "no", but I have no data to back that up.

Ok, with all of that out of the way, let's dig into my commentary. 

The following numbered headlines and quotes below are taken [straight from the article](https://medium.com/simple-human/floating-labels-are-a-bad-idea-82edb64220f6).

### 1. There is no space for a hint
The article states:

> Floating labels start inside the text box leaving no space for an additional hint.

<figure>
<img src="/content/images/2017/06/1-hint.png" alt="no space" />
<figcaption>Image taken from <a href="https://medium.com/simple-human/floating-labels-are-a-bad-idea-82edb64220f6">Floating Labels Are Problematic</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Ok, so if you intend to put a hint or a note above the input field and directly below the label, then yes, a float label **will** hinder your ability to do that.

However, If you really wanted a note or a hint, you could move it **below** the input field and simply push the other field down a bit.

Debating over hint placement is futile, unless you have an extremely clear picture of the exact problem trying to be solved with a form in the first place.

In some cases hints or labels are incredibly helpful and in other cases they are a bandaid on a poorly designed form. It simply can't be an absolute standard out of context.

### 2. They are hard-to-read
The article states:

> Floating labels typically have small text, so that as it floats, it takes up a small amount of space. But small text is hard-to-read.

<figure>
<img src="/content/images/2017/06/2-readability.png" alt="readability" />
<figcaption>Image taken from <a href="https://medium.com/simple-human/floating-labels-are-a-bad-idea-82edb64220f6">Floating Labels Are Problematic</a></figcaption>
</figure>

That really depends on the size of the text. And "hard to read" is a variable, not a constant, based on the user's eyesight.

Furthermore, text size is relative to a design in general—not float labels themselves. It's quite possible to have float labels be the same size as a standard label.

If text is displayed at a standard size of 16 – 18px, it's generally acceptable as *readable*. Perhaps more so than say a 12 – 14px size.

So let's agree for a moment that 18px is in fact easier to read than 12px...

Is it too unfathomable to assume that an easily read 16 – 18px, contextually scaled to a 12 – 14px after a user starts typing, would be suddenly too small to read?

I don't deny that 12px can be harder to read than 18px, but I see a float label as *an artifact of the past*, rather than a *clue to the future*.

It's a leftover indication rather than an instruction of what to do.

### 3. They need space to move into

The article states:

> Floating labels needs space to move into. If label text is friendly (see previous point), there would be no saved space anyway — just more white space.

<figure>
<img src="/content/images/2017/06/3-space.png" alt="space" />
<figcaption>Image taken from <a href="https://medium.com/simple-human/floating-labels-are-a-bad-idea-82edb64220f6">Floating Labels Are Problematic</a></figcaption>
</figure>

This is true, absolutely.

The float labels need space to move into and this is one of the trickiest problems to nail for the pattern.

[Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/floating-labels-problematic/) even wrote up his thoughts on this particular issue as well and concluded float labels don't save any vertical height at all. 

**BUT...**

If you agree that the Float Label *is an artifact*, rather than an instruction, you might also agree that it's *ok to go slightly smaller in text size* than a standard label.

And with a smaller text size, say 12px instead of 16px, you would effectively save 4 or more pixels of space. Possibly even 8px since you wouldn't need to add extra margin below the label in the traditional sense.

We're really getting down into the weeds here, pixel-wise, but a great interface designer will be painfully aware of a 4px discrepancy and the affects it can have on the whole design if used properly or improperly.

So if you save 8px on 5 input fields in a form, you've saved a total of 40px. That's roughly the same height of a button on mobile screen.

Would that helpful for your project? I don't know. You, as the designer, will have to decide that for every use case you come across.

---

Let me give you a real world example of a giant complex form I worked on a few years back.

The project involved an insane amount of data for commercial shipping and transportation logistics. We were truly trying to make the complex, simple.

The forms below are screenshots of "work in progress" designs that I pulled up from the archive.

The **left** form uses a combination of top aligned labels and left aligned labels. We were experimenting—trying to land on the perfect solution.

Then, I designed the form on the **right** as an alternative to the shear amount of craziness going on in the form. We all agreed that it *felt* more clean, less overwhelming, and better overall.

<figure>
<img src="/content/images/2017/06/float-label-comparison.png" alt="float label comparision side by side" />
<figcaption>Image taken from the <a href="https://dribbble.com/mds/projects/167479-Shiplify">Shiplify project</a> from 2014</figcaption>
</figure>

You can see that *even though only half of the fields were top aligned* it still resulted in over 420px of vertical height saved.  

We even had a few impromptu tests where we asked people, "which of these forms looks less overwhelming?" And they agreed the form on the right seemed better.

I know this isn't 100% valid and statistically conclusive testing, but still, it's a start.

I would LOVE to get something like this properly tested one day, but until then it's an intuition, not a fact.

There are so many variables like content type, preexisting user knowledge, and more that make any single form test simply not 100% applicable for all future forms.

### 4. The animation is problematic

The article states:

> Animation, even if it’s done well, could be distracting and disorientating, particularly for low confidence or visually impaired users. And, when zooming in, the label may disappear off screen.

Hang on a sec. If an animation is done well, then it is **by definition** "well," "good," "satisfactory," "to be desired," etc.

Therefore the phrase "distracting and disorienting" can't coexist with "done well." 

<figure>
<img src="/content/images/2017/06/float-label-animation.gif" alt="float label animation" style="max-width: 538px; width: 100%;"/>
<figcaption>Animation taken from <a href="http://learnaiux.com">learnaiux.com</a> case study form</figcaption>
</figure>

I know that I'm incredibly biased, but when I fill out a form that really nails the Float Label animation, I get a teensy tiny little dopamine rush when the animation resolves and I move on to the next field. A small sense of completion that wasn't quite there before.

It's reminds me of a game where something visually happens in the wake of your character's path. Like a footprint. 

I feel like I can't preface this enough, though. If float labels don't make sense for your project and adds too much unnecessary complexity, then please, by all means, don't use it.

I will still happily use your form if the other end of your form solves my problem.

### 5. They have poor contrast

The article states:

> Like placeholder text, floating labels have low contrast to differentiate it but low contrast text is hard-to-read.

> Depending on the design, when the label floats outside of the field, its colour will need to change. Otherwise the text will be lost against the background colour.

<figure>
<img src="/content/images/2017/06/5-contrast.png" alt="contrast" />
<figcaption>Image taken from <a href="https://medium.com/simple-human/floating-labels-are-a-bad-idea-82edb64220f6">Floating Labels Are Problematic</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Low contrast has nothing to do with a float label and has everything to do with size and color.

The minimum [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) states that a color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 is necessary to pass AA guidelines for regular text size below 18~px.

The *lightest* grey color hex code that produces a passable AA contrast ratio is `#767676` or `#757777` on `#ffffff` (white) background. This is *if* you are using a regular font weight below 18px. If you're using a bold font weight at 14px size you can defer to the *large* contrast ratio the WCAG provides, which is 3.5:1 and ends up being `#898989` on `#ffffff`. [Side note: this is my favorite contrast checker](http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/).

Sidenote: I've designed projects for banks that require a minimum AA contrast rating for their digital product. I haven't personally come across a client that required more than AA, but we did set AAA as a goal (and hit it) when [we designed Exxon's Unity Design System](https://bigmedium.com/projects/unity-design-system-exxonmobil.html).

Ok, I've gotten waaaaaay off subject, but my point is that *this* is a color and design issue, not a float label issue.

### 6. They may be mistaken for a value

The article states:

> People may skip the field thinking it’s completed already. When they submit, they will see an error which needs fixing. This is frustrating and time consuming.

This is a very valid point and also why color and hierarchy are of the utmost importance when designing interfaces.

Darker labels above empty input fields are pretty hard to mistake for something already in the field.

If you set a precedent for the user by having floating labels activate on user input AND the user input text color is much darker than the placeholder color—say `#767676` versus `#222222`—then the possibility of confusion could be much lower.

I can't matter of factly say that this won't be an issue. I don't believe it would be in many cases, but making that assumption without hard data would be ignorant on my part.

Please design placeholders and labels wisely. If you're using proper contrast between placeholder color and user input color, this should solve any problems you might encounter. 

### 7. They are inconsistently located

The article states:

> Radio buttons, checkboxes and select boxes have static labels and legends. Where as text boxes have floating labels. This creates an inconsistent experience.

> When looking at a text box, for example, the user has to look inside the control. For a select box they have to look outside of it.

<figure>
<img src="/content/images/2017/06/7-consistency.png" alt="consistency" />
<figcaption>Image taken from <a href="https://medium.com/simple-human/floating-labels-are-a-bad-idea-82edb64220f6">Floating Labels Are Problematic</a></figcaption>
</figure>

This is a design problem, not a float label problem. Shopify does an incredible job with the float label on their input fields and select boxes.

<figure>
<img src="/content/images/2017/06/shopify-float-label-1.gif" alt="shopify checkout" />
<figcaption>Shopify's <a href="https://checkout.shopify.com/2755465/checkouts/7940510d5c85f6494c74392a7d46c87b">standard checkout form</a></figcaption>
</figure>

### 8. The label may get cropped

The article states:

> If the floating label is longer than the size of the field, it will be cut off by the field. We should design for content, we shouldn’t make content fit the design.

<figure>
<img src="/content/images/2017/06/8-cutoff.png" alt="consistency" />
<figcaption>Image taken from <a href="https://medium.com/simple-human/floating-labels-are-a-bad-idea-82edb64220f6">Floating Labels Are Problematic</a></figcaption>
</figure>

This isn't a float label issue per se, this is a bad form design issue.

No one should ever have a placeholder label that long.

And if you do *truly need* to ask a two line question as an input label, then I 100% recommend NOT using a float label.

It just doesn't make sense for that use case.

### 9. They ignore the standards

The article states:

> We know placeholders are problematic anyway. However, if we’re going to put text inside a text box, it should be a hint, not a label.

[This is the standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-placeholder-attribute) the article references. It reads:

> The placeholder attribute represents a short hint (a word or short phrase) intended to aid the user with data entry. A hint could be a sample value or a brief description of the expected format. 

Hmmm, "A word or a short phrase intended to aid the user" sounds like it could describe a **label**! 

Now the *standard* documents also say:

>The placeholder attribute should not be used as an alternative to a label.

I'm fully aware that there are circumstances that require an external label **and** additional placeholder data to really help out certain field input types. Sometimes you need to pull out all the stops when designing forms to really cover all the bases.

I agree 100% that *no* label and *only* placeholder data is a bad idea. That's why the float label exists!

The float label was created AFTER this standard was written. Is it not worth challenging original assumptions in old documents  after new ideas arise? Especially ones that are getting adopted so quickly. 

Is it reasonable to get curious about this rather than dismissive?

There's got to be *some* valid reason why **Google** adopted this pattern as a standard in [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/components/text-fields.html#).

In addition to Google, the following companies have adopted float label patterns in their apps.

1. Shopify
2. Slack
3. Digital Ocean
4. Delta
5. Invision
6. Lots more...

## Summary

The article states:

> Forms are not a source of entertainment. The floating label won’t make users enjoy using forms. Users don’t care. They just want the outcome.

I just simply disagree. A user who is entertained is much more likely to remember their experience with your product.

I will add a caveat though that you shouldn't put entertainment above functionality and clarity.

> There are better and more productive techniques for improving form design. Let’s spend time and energy on those instead.

I definitely agree with the first sentence and sometimes improving form design is removing fields or rethinking if a form is even necessary.

But shouldn't we spend time on ALL facets of form design improvement?

### Profit Sharing
- Each contributing designer will receive 9% of all sales profits, in perpetuity.

###### Potential Sales Scenarios
*(minus unavoidable transaction fees, etc.)*

- 1,000 course sales ($99,000)
    - 9% equals ~**$8,910** for you 
- 10,000 course sales ($990,000)
    - 9% equals ~**$89,100** for you 
- 100,000 course sales ($9,900,000)
    - 9% of gross equals ~**$891,000** for you 

FWIW, I've made over *$60,000* with my AIUX course, and that was *only me* doing content, design, marketing etc. all by myself. 

**99 Pro Tips** would have much more mass appeal to the design community because of everyone involved *and* the great price tag.

Plus everyone's combined audiences across multiple channels would make for a phenomenal marketing strategy.

### Content
- 11 design (hacks, tricks, tips) videos per person (total of 99)
    - 5~ minutes each
    - **Something you're most passionate about**
    - Your best design tips that someone else can put into their own arsenal. 
    - examples
        - a way of thinking about a problem
        - simple process things that you’ve internalized
        - the way you setup your documents
        - choosing colors, typography, grids
        - dealing with photos
        - naming conventions
        - making design decisions
        - folder structure
        - software specific tricks
        - client management
        - email scripts
        - finding clients
        - sales processes
        - contracts
        - anything that is a little nugget of wisdom from you, a seasoned design pro 
        - don’t over think it! =)

Here are some random notes on some videos I'm thinking of for this...

<img src="/content/images/2017/01/IMG_6698.PNG" alt="mds notes" style="max-width: 375px;" />

### Contributing Designer Responsibilities 
**The big idea here** is to give you a very small amount of workload that can deliver enormous returns in the future with the collective power of the full team.

- Write a simple outline of the 11 tips you’d like to share
- Videos can be individual piece meal or can build on one another in a sequence
- **I can hold your hand every step of the video-way if this makes you uncomfortable at all!**
- Screen record all 11 videos and upload to Dropbox, etc. (I can provide lots of technical support on the video production side).
- Ideally the videos would be around 5 minutes in length. Maximum of  10~ minutes. This would allow 1-2 hours of video content per designer. 9-18 hours of total video course time.
- I can handle editing of videos as needed. I can also help copy edit and orchestrate all of the content (video, medium posts, email scripts, etc)
- Decide which video would be the best to make publicly available, for the sales page.
- Write one medium post about your contribution to the course (keep private until the course is live)
- Prepare 1 or more Dribbble shots (keep private until the course is live)
- 1 blurb about your videos (to use on the sales page)
- 1 simple email written about your publicly available video and a tease for the others
- You're also completely welcome to help out in other ways, but the main goal is to get the most bang for the buck without a huge time sink

### Pre-release Marketing
- We’ll record and produce all videos before the public announcement of the course and pushing the splash page live.
- We’ll have a simple splash page with video trailer of the course, contributing designers featured, a simple message from each one, and a form to collect first names and emails as the primary CTA
- A short and friendly prewritten email sequence, sent out over a 3-week period.
- We'll *leak out* 3 videos per week for three weeks during the prelaunch phase to give everyone something to tweet (etc.) about 3 times per week.
- Total of 9 free videos publicly available on the website for visitors to get a feel for the content and build trust.
- One message from each contributing designer per email, with a preview of which designer will come next in the sequence.
- 3-week time period between splash page announcement and sales page going live.
- Each contributing designer reaches out to his or her social networks via their own Newsletter and/or Dribbble, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. to let them know they will be contributing to the course with a launch date of +9 weeks to promote the splash page and collect emails.
- Ideally post at least once during each of the 9 prelaunch weeks.
- The collected emails will be an important distribution channel for initial sales. 

### Post-release Marketing Plan
- Proper sales page with a video previews of the course content—1 tip per designer publicly available on the sales page. (total of 9 free pro tips)
- Post on Product Hunt
- 9 (or more posts) on Dribbble (at least 1 per designer)
- Post on Designer News (each designer available for community Q/A)
- Post on Hacker News
- Post on Reddit 
- 1 Medium post per contributing designer about the course and their free tip that can be viewed on the sales page
- 9 post-release sales emails (1 per designer) to subscribers to describe their free tip on the sales page. Promote early bird special, etc.
- Early-bird purchase deal of X%-off of course price that counts down over 1-2 weeks.
- After early bird deals expire, course remains publicly available for sale indefinitely.
- At the completion of each of the 99 lessons the course app will track the user’s progress and give the opportunity to tweet about finishing the current lesson, with a link to the sales page, for a nice marketing loop.
- Can repeat deals/special countdowns through out the year (once a quarter)

# Superbly Ordinary

While writing the lessons for the Typography module in my upcoming [Shift Nudge](https://shiftnudge.com) course, I came across this little gem in "Elements of Typographic Style," a book by Robert Bringhurst.

> ...a (type) face of modest merits should be handled with great discretion, formality, and care. It should be set in modest sizes (better yet, in one size only) with the caps well spaced, the lines well leaded, and the lower case well fitted and modestly kerned. The line length should be optimal and the page impeccably proportioned. In short, the typography should be richly and superbly **ordinary**, so that attention is drawn to the quality of the composition, not to the individual letterforms.

# Teehan + Lax Joins Facebook

[And Now, For Our Next Act](http://www.teehanlax.com)

Teehan + Lax just closed their studio doors and moved into Facebook. Good for them–they've made a big decision. Make sure you read the entire post before you make some snarky comment on Twitter, judging their intentions.

>The three of us agreed we would look at 3 factors in every offer:

>**Professional**<br/>
Were the challenges we would be asked to work on, professionally interesting to us? Did we like and respect the people we would be working with and for? Was the company a company we wanted to come to work at?

>**Personal**<br/>
Were we going to be happy? We knew that this decision had personal implications on our happiness. Owning your own business has a lot of freedom. Would we be OK with losing that? What about our families and relationships? What if we needed to relocate? Would we be happy living somewhere else?

>**Economic**<br/>
Was the economic opportunity greater than what we could do on our own? Did the economics of the deal capture the upside in a reasonable way?

This is a great way to break down your own professional decisions about projects and opportunities as well.

Good luck to Jon, Geoff, David, and anyone else making the leap with them. We're all counting on you to continue making awesome stuff!

Oh, make sure you read the [Teehan + Lax origin story](http://www.teehanlax.com/story/teehan-lax/), too.

# The Grass is Greener Where You Water It

![grass](/content/images/2014/May/grass.jpg)
*Photo Credit: [Thomas Bresson](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2011-09-10_10-49-45-gouttes.jpg)*

In 2010, I met [Matthew Smith](http://twitter.com/whale), who has an equally awesome name. My wife was *really* into couponing at the time and frequented a site called [Southern Savers](http://southernsavers.com) to get her deal fix.

Naturally, I would catch glimpses of the site here and there as she created her grocery lists. One day, I noticed that the site had dramatically changed from a hacked-up default Wordpress theme to a beautiful custom design complete with branding, typography, illustrations and such.

I quickly hijacked my wife's computer to investigate. As I scrolled to the footer, I saw "Site made by [Squared Eye](http://web.archive.org/web/20101130025119/http://squaredeye.com/)" so naturally I clicked the link.

"Whoa, this dude's name is Matthew Smith," I thought to myself as I ogled the work of this fantastically named man. After poking around a bit, I connected with him on Twitter and we conversed about our dopplegänger-ness. 

In the coming weeks I learned about the coworking space he started in Greenville, SC as well as casual event called *Zero Day*, held on the last friday of every month. It was a small half-day event of the cowork peeps and a few others from the community, partaking in bagels, coffee, and 10/20s (small 10 and 20 minute topical discussions). Matthew invited me up for one to meet him and the crew, so I made the trek.

The vibe at the coworking space in Greenville was phenomenal. The architecture, the desks, the people, the coffee, the layout, everything. It was a great experience and I immediately knew I needed something like this in my life.

[Check out the 360º tour I made of the Cowork Greenville space.](http://mds.sh/coworkgreenville/)

![cowork greenville](/content/images/2014/May/cowork1.png)
![cowork greenville](/content/images/2014/May/cowork2.png)
![cowork greenville](/content/images/2014/May/cowork3.png)

The next spring I attended the second annual [Greenville Grok](http://theironyard.com/grok), which was an extension of *Zero Day* on a slightly larger scale. It did not disappoint and I left the event supercharged after having many quality conversations about work and life with fellow industry workers.

I visited Greenville a handful of times afterwards and continued to be enamored with the folks there. Greenville really felt like a larger Athens - the city where my wife and I have lived since college.

Matthew always joked "When are you moving to Greenville?" while I was there, and after awhile the joke started taking root a bit in my mind. I started having serious conversations with my wife, who was surprisingly excited about the possibility of moving to Greenville and doing something new.

It's dangerously easy to get into the *grass is greener on the other side* mindset and that's what started to happen for us. Immediately, Athens seemed boring and old, versus the vibrant, luscious and ripe Greenville that presented seemingly unlimited opportunities.

There are always lots of factors to consider on matters as weighty as *where to live*, like distance to family, friends, existing roots, not to mention if you have kids - we had three at the time and as a matter of fact, just had our [fourth](http://mattdsmith.com/four). 

After a week of conversations here and there with my wife I started to realize the truth about Athens and Greenville. Yes Greenville is awesome, but so is Athens. I've been in Athens for 10 years. I've got friends, connections, familiarity, a solid church community, and my family is only a few hours away - easy driving distance. The food scene, the art scene, and even the [tech scene](http://fourathens.com), are all great things about Athens. My eyes had just been covered with laziness and indifference.

## I Once Was Blind, But Now I See
Once I stirred up the stagnation in my heart, something clicked and I felt this peace about being in Athens; being closer to my family. I realized the grass is not always greener on the other side, but rather **the grass is greener where you water it.** 

I felt like it was time to ramp up my local game, stop complaining about the lack of design community in Athens, that I had yet to search for, and see what I could do to cultivate it. At the very least, pry up the corners and see if any currently existed.

After working in an office by myself for nearly 2 years doing independent work, the appeal of a cowork was massive.

*I wanted to start a coworking space in Athens.*

I only knew a few folks in town that were candidates for such a space and I saw *finding people* as my first hurdle.

As soon as this moment clicked for me and I knew that Athens was where I was going to live and stay (and thrive!), I started reaching out to people. My first email was blasted off to [Aarron](http://twitter.com/aarron) and [Gregg](http://twitter.com/greggcorp) from Mailchimp, two Athens residents like myself, to see if they'd be interested in coworking if I got one started. After all, they work from home a few days a week and both have kids as well. Certainly they felt some sort of domestic pinch while working.

Gregg mentioned that I should reach out to some of the guys at Four Athens, a grass roots tech incubator in town. I heard of Four Athens a while back but sort of dismissed the idea and never thought much of it again. I did some digging and reached out to [Jim](http://twitter.com/jamesjflannery), the project director, and asked him to meet for coffee to chat coworking stuff. 

We met and I realized that starting a cowork would be tough to do when I didn't really have anyone to cowork with. That's sort of an important in this equation. In fact that **is** the main ingredient - coworkers creating cool things in a work-like utopia.

I knew that I needed to get some community going before I could make any solid progress on a coworking space. Jim was very gracious to promptly connect me with a number of folks around town, whom might have similar interests.

## Transform Athens
Jim email intro'd me with Jacob Thomason, who started and runs [Rentpost](http://rentpost.com) full-time. Jacob is a talented designer and developer and I couldn't believe there was someone like this living in Athens.

We met for lunch at [Last Resort](http://www.lastresortgrill.com), one of the amazing local restaurants in town. The weather was superb - sunny, breezy, and I was seated by the hostess on the patio shortly before Jacob's arrival. I was in a rather good mood to meet a fellow designer so I ordered a beer for a mini-celebration while I waited.

Jacob arrived and we began to share our stories and backgrounds. He told me about his time living in Asia, while he coded up Rentpost and I told him about my [business partner/friend](http://twitter.com/imissedtheshock) in Singapore and my trip over there for a [big project](http://studiomds.co/work/spacetobe). This was a type of conversation that previously only existed at conferences for me. It was very refreshing to meet someone locally like this. 

I told Jacob about my idea for a coworking space in Athens and that I was considering starting a design-focused meetup to get to know the community and see who was interested. Jacob liked the idea and said that he didn't know of anything that existed beyond a few developer meetups he was a part already a part of. There's nothing like someone completely buying into the seedling of an idea to get you pumped up to press forward.

After lunch, Jacob and I exchanged emails. He told me that he loved the idea of starting a meetup focused on design, etc. and that he'd help co-start it if I was up for that. I immediately said yes.

We continued tossing emails back and forth about the logistics of starting it up. The *very first thing* we did was set a date for the first event. [Things aren't really official until your set a date](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/05/set-a-date.html).

April 25, 2013 - Athens Design Group (Official Name TBD). We didn't have a schedule, a speaker, a name, a format, anything. I had no clue what I was doing, but felt relieved that Jacob was involved in 2 other local meetups we could borrow ideas from.

We set a date, got Jim to put our event on the Four Athens email blast and started telling people about it. Now the pressure was on to follow through. We came up with a name for the group, Transform, and I threw together a presentation about *Lightning Fast Photoshop Techniques*.

I emailed *MailChimp* to see if they'd be interested in sponsoring our first three events to handle food and beverage. They obliged and we were on our way. Check out all of the past events [here](http://www.meetup.com/transform-athens#past)

## Fast Forward 1 Year
Transform went very well over the last year. My goal of meeting new folks in the design community was absolutely reached and continues to exceed my expectations. We've had some [great presentations](http://www.meetup.com/transform-athens#past) along the way and it's been a really fun thing to start and be a part of. 

During the first year of Transform, I continued to pitch the idea of a coworking space to whoever would listen. I had several conversations with Jim about it and the possibility of collaborating with Four Athens, but the timing was never quite right.

## Brainstorming Coworking
[Jami Mays](http://twitter.com/imajworks), another designer and developer in Athens, contacted me after she heard about Transform. She had also been thinking about coworking for awhile and we started chatting about it. This was super exciting to have another person equally as passionate about the idea.

Jami and I started meeting and planning the would-be coworking space. We made lists of potential candidates that each of us knew, shopped around potential spaces, and created a budget.

We went through spurts of progress followed by periods of stagnation. Each of us would get busy with work or life and things would stall.

I sought out a few proposals on a some different spaces, but none of it felt right in terms of timing ore cost. I wasn't willing to commit to a big lease and shoulder the burden of the entire rent, while hoping to find tenants to break even. I constantly had to remind myself that the hardest part was going to be getting *actual people* to cowork with before the space would work.

We eventually decided, "You know what!? Let's just start a group and meet at a coffee shop to get people working together." We started a mobile coworking group that first met at a local restaurant, [Big City Bread](http://www.bigcitybreadcafe.com). We decided on 8am to 12pm for a work session followed by lunch together. Only 5 or so people showed up, but it still felt like progress.

An Athens reporter caught wind and came by to do a [little story](http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2014-01-11/athens-entrepreneurs-aim-engineered-serendipity-coworking-spaces) on us. I've never seen a reporter take notes with a pen and pad, while asking questions and making direct eye contact the entire time. Color me impressed.

## Partnering with Jim 
A few months after the mobile cowork soiree, Jim reached back out to me about the coworking space idea. He told me about a company owner in town who was willing to make a small investment in a space to attract more designers to the area.

Four Athens has a main building with offices plus additional spaces here and there throughout downtown Athens - all various offices that small companies can rent for cheap, but none of them had the potential to be a big, open, creative coworking space.

Jim told me about a deal he was able to negotiate with the owners of the [Bottleworks](http://bottleworks.net) on a potential space, along with the potential investor and asked me if I wanted to join forces to put things in motion.

The stars aligned and the universes hummed to the tune of coworking. Logistics for renting office space and desks already existed through Four Athens, so all I had to do was rent a desk while Four Athens backed the coworking space from a rent and admin perspective.

We began, planning, renovating, and spreading the word. I had used the term *Cowork Athens* to reference my vision in the past, but we both agreed the space needed a name. After a few emails back and forth, we settled on the *The Quad*.

My role was (and is) to be the go-to guy at the space - the Four Athens liaison, if you will. The Quadfather?

## We're Coworking!
It's been 3 months since I moved from my solo office to my new *open* desk at The Quad. I've met new people, made new friends, and have been really excited to go there each day for work. It's energizing being around other people in the industry who are passionate about what they do.

When I made the move from my office of 2 years to the coworking space, it was [bittersweet](http://mattdsmith.com/bittersweet/), but I haven't regretted it once.

If you're ever in Athens, [hit me up](http://twitter.com/mds), come by The Quad, work for the day, grab some coffee, or just say "Hi!"

We're constantly adding things to the space, but for now check out some pictures below. You can follow *The Quad* on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/thequadco) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/thequadco).

# The Not So Secret Productivity Secret

<iframe src='https://spoken.co/t/2483687/embed' frameborder='0' width='100%' height='84'></iframe>

The big secret is not so secret. Are you ready for it? You get a list of things you need to do and you do them. Bam! Secret is out.

The days when I’m productive, when I know what I need to do and I do those things, I feel confident. The days where I piddle around, spin my wheels, and question everything all day long– look at Facebook a few more times, refresh my Twitter feed a few more times, I start to get doubtful and fearful about what I’m doing. 

>Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy. - Dale Carnegie

It’s obvious what needs to be done, I just have to keep doing it. Here’s a quick snapshot of my [AIUX](/aiux) course progress. The rows in green are the course videos that I’ve recorded. Everything below that is on deck.

# The Thing With Money

I recently got an email from a young guy in Hong Kong. He's just getting started in graphic design and emailed to ask me about pricing techniques. Ah, It seems like just yesterday I was sitting in graphic design class asking my professors the same questions about the dark art of pricing. A dark art it is, my friends. Don't let the dark arts scare you though - you should keep pressing in and figure out how they work.

Learning to price things can be a brutal process, but like [Ron Burgundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8OxKx6zKkQ), it's kind of a big deal.

Kudos to this guy, for trying to get his head wrapped around it early. Here's the email with a few tiny edits for good measure:

>Hello Mr. Matt,

>I'm from Hong Kong and a beginner in graphic design. 

>While I’m planning to do some design-related "work" for this summer, I got confused about the thing with "money." Therefore, seeing that you are a professional and a well-experienced UI/UX designer, I have some questions for you :P

>1. How do you estimate the money you should receive for a project? By number of screens, the content, or…?

>2. Given that it’ll be a fixed price payment, do you prefer payment at last or by milestones?

>3. For a scrolling screen (which sometimes would be long), do you consider it as one screen, or two?

>6. Do you mind to provide the following information? Number of screens and the amount of payment you received? (If its confidential or you don’t want to provide, it’s k :P)

---

The "thing with money" is an easy thing to get confused about. It's something that I still struggle with and experiment with even after a decade of experience. It helps to think of it as an art rather than a science. 

There are definitely a few guidelines you can use as a rule of thumb, but ultimately it comes down to a personal decision based on a number of factors. I'll try to break it down accordingly.

## 1 - How do you estimate the money you should receive for a project, by number of screens, the content, or…?? 

When does the client need the work finished versus how soon can you realistically complete the work? In other words, is this a rush job or is the timeline a reasonable one?

If you are estimating a project based on a fixed price, you also need to have a fixed timeline, and a fixed payment schedule. It's not fair to you as the service provider to work on an indefinite schedule without a definite payment plan. Not only do you lose money by spending unaccounted time on a project, you lose motivation, resent the client, and lose opportunities to pursue other projects that could be scheduled during your unaccounted time-spillage.

If you estimate the amount of work to be 2 weeks of heads down design, you still need to factor in client reviews (Skype, Google Hangouts, or in my personal favorite - in person) as well as revisions, etc. I like to factor at least a day or two after a design presentation, for the client to provide written feedback to solidify what was discussed during the meeting.

You need to lead this process, otherwise the client will just do what comes naturally and start saying, "What if we did this? What if we did that? Can you try that? What about this completely different concept?"

If you don't have a process in place, you'll start to squirm in your chair, unsure of how to deal with this feedback and mountain of unexpected work the client is proposing.

They are honest questions from the client, so be prepared to tell him or her that it is out of scope. Or alternatively, that you *could* do the extra work but it would require a change order (change in price and deliverables).

Use your best judgement when handling these cases. Sometimes you can create some really high value by throwing in a little extra work on top, but let it be on your terms, not theirs.

Before you begin on a project, make sure you to take the lead as the project manager clearly outlining the timeline, the scope, the deliverables, payment plans, etc. Otherwise you'll have a never-ending spiral of emails, time wasted, and more. You'll end up making exponentially less money that you originally thought.

Number of screens is a good starting point for figuring out how much time it will take you to complete the designs. 

Most of the time the client will be curious about your hourly rate or if you prefer to give an estimate for the project. Think about it from the client's perspective. If you were hiring a designer to create a certain number of screens, would you be willing to pay an hourly rate without having a idea of how long it would take?

Whether you're billing hourly or on a fixed rate, you'll need to come up with a realistic estimation of how long the project will take. Your estimations will probably suck at first, and get progressively better as you gain more experience. 

It's a good idea to start with smaller projects (1-2 weeks) at first, so you don't completely screw yourself by doing a horrible job at estimating a 3 month project with a fixed rate, when it actually takes 5 months. I've done that before and it totally sucked.

I'm not sure about design wages in Hong Kong, but in the US, hiring a designer can cost you anywhere from $15-$150 per hour and beyond, depending on experience, proficiency, etc. A good rule of thumb is "you get what you pay for."

I'd suggest thinking of an hourly rate you'd be happy with earning for the project and use that as your multiplier. If you'd be content with receiving $20/hour (insert any hourly rate) for a project you'd estimate at 1 week or 40 hours, you'd be looking at $800 for the project. Just be sure to think about how you're willing to handle revisions, reviews, etc.

## 2 - Given that it’ll be a fixed price payment, do you prefer payment at last or by milestones?

This depends on a few things. How bad you need the money? How much do you trust the client? Is this a huge expense for the client of a small expense? Is this a huge project for you or a small one?

If you need money quickly then you should absolutely ask for half up front. This also serves as earnest money from the client that will let you know he or she is serious about hiring you for the project. The project is not a project until you have an agreement about payment or preferably, money in the bank.

If it's a small project from someone you trust, then you should feel comfortable doing the work, sending an invoice, and collecting payment afterwards. Even so, you still need an agreement about when you get paid. It's best to say X amount due by X date, with no strings attached. Make it simple and straight forward. You and the client both need to know the payment plan.

I've done projects based on a pie in the sky estimate which was verbally agreed to by the client, but I had no plan in place for deliverables or payment. I got most of the way through the designs, the client became non-responsive to emails or phone calls. I sent him the final invoice and never got paid. I blame myself for not having a solid agreement and process in place.

The same goes for your design deliverables. Put in writing what you'll be responsible for, when you will deliver the final version, and what format it will be in. This way there is no confusion over what the client is expecting and what you're planning on delivering.

You can break up a fixed rate fee into 1/4 payments, but it really warrants a discussion between you and the client. It may be a hassle for the client to have to write 4 checks instead of 2 or 1. Likewise, it could be a hassle for you to send four invoices, especially for a project with a short timeline.


## 3 - For a scrolling screen (which sometimes would be long), do you consider it as one screen, or two?

I wouldn't tie your pricing or estimate to a general "screen" as this could vary wildly depending on the content. Think about it more contextually and make sure you have solid definitions for your terms. One scrolling screen could take 1 day or 30 days depending on the content. 

It's fine to call it one screen, but not to estimate it as such. You'll need to break it down into sections. And even further, do the sections need custom illustrations or icons? Will you need to do any photography, copywriting, or *gasp* stock photo searching? All of these tasks need to be factored into your estimate for each section, which will ultimately add up to be one screen.

You'll also need to ask about making it responsive and providing a mobile design. Things like this increase the scope quite a bit. 

The bottom line is this, make sure there are no grey areas in your communication with the client in terms of defining things. Iron out the details of the content you'll produce as well as the payment you'll receive.

## 4. How do you report your progress to the client? By email, Skype, Invision App, or…?

Mostly email for standard communication of dates, progress, notes, questions, meetings, etc. and sometimes Basecamp for larger projects. I'm not a big fan of having open Skype communication from the very beginning unless it's a trusted client who has earned the right to have direct access to me and knows how to respect that. 

Invision is good for showing prototypes, but it depends on your project. A one page scrolling site doesn't really gain anything from being inside of Invision as the client can just scroll up and down a big jpg.

My go to for storing files and having a client review them is Dropbox. I have a project folder with a "For Review" sub folder. Inside of that are dated folders that I save out design comps to. I'll email the client a link to the dated folder as opposed to sending email attachments.


## 5. For you in particular, how fast do you work? 1 screen per hour, or 1 screen per day?

The biggest thing to remember is that quality work takes time, no matter how experienced you are. I don't like to give myself less than one full day to work on anything substantial. It's typically better to allow 2-3 days as a minimum to work on any one project, as you get to sleep on your decisions and get ideas about better treatments, implementations, etc. over that stretch of time.

In general though, I do work very fast, but I also see that as being extremely valuable as opposed to being thought of as an efficient and cheap laborer. This is where billing hourly versus billing for value comes into play. My friend, Dan Mall, wrote a [good article](http://danielmall.com/articles/value-pricing/) on value pricing and curated lots of resources on the matter. Definitely check that out. 

## 6. Do you mind to provide the following information? Number of screens and the amount of payment you received? (If its confidential or you don’t want to provide, it’s ok :P)

It would be nice if there was some magical design menu that everyone could pull from and grab prices, but unfortunately it doesn't exist in the real world. I wouldn't mind sharing the details of a project plus payment I received, but you wouldn't have a strong context for the scenario surrounding the deal for it to provide any real value.

Even in the case, I wouldn't have enough information about your project to give a good estimate and you wouldn't know enough about my pricing process for it to provide any real value to you.

To paraphrase Seth Godin, "Asking me about my productivity secrets are like asking [Richard Branson](http://mds.io/WTxv) what he had for dinner last night. It doesn't matter."

You have to ask yourself, "How much money will I be ok with making on this project and for what amount of time?" as well as "How much money do I think the client is willing *and* able to pay for?"

It never hurts to ask the client what their budget is up front. Lots of times they won't tell you, but you'll never know until you ask.

Pricing and negotiating is much more of an art form with a small amount of science behind it. You have to consider every factor. I've lost lots (more like LOTS) of projects by quoting way too high, but it usually didn't matter. I quoted higher prices when I didn't necessarily need the work. If I get in a situation where I need to bring work in, then I will lower my prices. It's a case of supply and demand.

If you're just starting out, come up with a price that feels comfortable for you, covers your expenses, and lets you walk away feeling good about the project. 

You can incrementally adjust your rate up as you get new projects. Just keep in mind that there are always multiple factors when quoting a project. Your time and availability is only a piece of the equation. You need to account for opportunity cost, positioning for the future, monetary needs versus monetary aspirations, and more.

From the clients perspective you need to factor in their timeline, budget, willingness to pay you, ability to pay you, when can they pay you, and more. Focus on the *value* you can provide for them in exchange for their money. Don't just focus on the designs and the screens when talking about pricing.

If you can focus on the client's hopes, fears, and dreams you will do well. Good luck!

# 2019 – State of Design Tools

This is my personal breakdown of the current state of design tools as we have just passed the halfway mark in the year 2019. 2020 is upon us people, this is not a drill.

*First, a very brief history of my experience...*

I started my foray into *computer graphic creation*™ with a super early version of Photoshop in the 90s when "layers" was a new feature.

I used Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, and InDesign during my Graphic Design studies throughout college. I continued to use Photoshop and Illustrator exclusively until Sketch gained more and more popularity amongst UI designers. It was 2014 when I finally moved to Sketch as my go-to tool over Photoshop and Illustrator.

Now in just 5 short years, in addition to [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) we now have [Figma](http://figma.com), [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Framer](http://framer.com), [InVision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio), and probably lots of others that aren't on my radar yet.

Let's break it down, shall we?

---

## Figma
![](/content/images/2019/07/figma.png)
Figma has currently taken the lead as my favorite tool to use.

I was very opposed to the idea of a web-based tool for a long time, but I forced myself to give it a shot for the first-time for a full project when I designed the [Streamline Icons](https://transactions.sendowl.com/stores/9358/48325) website over year ago. Collaborating with Vincent was a breeze and I was surprised at just how fast and thoughtful the feature set was within the tool.

Fast forward a year and it's only gotten faster and better. The team at Figma really seems to be paying attention to those super nerdy designer details that appear small on the surface, but can have a profound effect on your day to day as a designer. Things like not needing to reselect a different text layer to edit that text, or the tidy up feature, or finding and replacing multiple layer names. Just lots and lots of delightfully available shortcuts and more.

The mobile mirroring tool is the only thing, that from time to time, will give me some hiccups and need to be restarted. Other than that I really have no gripes with the software. It's fast and highly functional. What more could you ask for?

## Sketch
![](/content/images/2019/07/sketch.png)
The thing I still like about Sketch over Figma is the fact that all symbols (or components) all get sent to a separate master symbol page. The mental model of having a separate master sheet makes a lot of sense to me and I miss that when not using Sketch.

I would be almost as happy doing daily work in Sketch compared to Figma, except for the fact that Sketch starts stalling out way more often than Figma. Perhaps because of the heavy use of CPU vs. GPU? It would seem that a natively built app should outperform a web-based app, but that has not been my experience with Sketch vs. Figma.

Here’s some extremely non-scientific tests using popular design tools, where I drew a bunch of boxes with strokes and rotated them. <a href="https://t.co/kR4wNDppfL">pic.twitter.com/kR4wNDppfL</a></p>&mdash; Marc Edwards (@marcedwards) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcedwards/status/1151335728418193408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The sheer amount of plugins available for Sketch is very appealing and there are several I miss when using Figma exclusively. I do think this will be solved for Figma as they're about to make their plugin ecosystem live within the next few days of this article's publication.

However, Sketch is iterating their software very quickly, it's still a joy to use and I'm excited for the future.

## Adobe XD
![](/content/images/2019/07/xd.png)
When Adobe XD first came out as Project Comet, I was honored to be a part of the Customer Advisory Board. I really really really wanted XD to be my go-to tool, combining the vector power of Adobe Illustrator with the simplicity of Sketch. 

Adobe XD is absolutely lighting fast and hasn't once crashed on me that I can recall. Creating clickable prototypes is extremely  fast as well and the recent addition of "auto-animate" as a transition effect, is really nice—though somewhat limiting if you're really trying to tweak animation sequences.

The frustrating thing about XD for me are the little things I use all the time that are missing. The fact I can't hit `⌘ nudge` or `⌘ shift nudge` for scaling objects. There is no ability to add inner shadows to objects. No ability to add multiple fills or borders for quick experimentation. 

I can imagine that lots of these little niceties come with some type of performance cost and I do so appreciate XD's commitment to absolute lightning performance. 

I'm sure within the year, a lot of my trite complaints will be gone with the wind.

## InVision Studio
![](/content/images/2019/07/studio.png)
Studio is still incredibly early in their current state—having only been in the "public market of design tools" for a little over a year. Neither Sketch nor Figma was performant enough for me in their first year to serve as my full-time tool. I believe that with a little more time and with more enhanced performance, the tool will become much more widely adopted.

Studio is my number one go-to tool for [producing UI animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7okfgeJ7qA). There is simply not another app that can handle such robust screen to screen interactions between artboards. [Learn more about animating with Studio here](https://switchtostudio.com/).

I admittedly haven't used Principle and other animations tools that much so I don't have a good basis for comparison, but it's just so fast and easy for me to create UI animations with Studio, it continues to be my go-to tool for just that.

It's definitely a welcome replacement to my previous animation tool of choice, [the now-defunct Adobe Flash](http://mds.is/animating-dribbble-shots/).

## Framer X
![](/content/images/2019/07/framer.png)
Framer is definitely in different category from the other tools mentioned. The others are created much more from the traditional designer's point of view, whereas Framer is definitely coming from an "actual product" perspective. 

I've recently used Framer exclusively on a 4 month long project. Some of the concepts in Framer where hard for me to grasp at first, even as a seasoned designer who fancies himself as a quick tool adopter.

Learning that you can't hit `⌘ G` to group objects is a bit of a mind-bender at first, but you'll learn eventually to hit `⌘ return` to convert something into a new frame. The frames concept is definitely a different mental model to grok, but I've actually learned to love it near the end of the project.

The biggest downside for me using Framer has to be the speed and performance of the application. I simply didn't feel fast and efficient moving things around and making a mess with designs.

I feel much more free and unhindered during my exploration process with a tool like Figma or Sketch. Framer feels much more positioned as the tool to use when you're ready to build you actual UI that will go into production. This is great, but not for exploration when you want to iterate through 5 ideas as fast as possibly with an infinite canvas.

Another thing I do love about Framer is the ability to create one Frame with UI on top of another Frame connected as a content panel—think of a scrolling list beneath a title and tab bar. Previewing this type of content was really nice in Framer and I like the ability to separate different views like that.

The ability to add code to pieces of the UI is also incredibly powerful, but I simply don't know enough JavaScript syntax to know what's available. I'm a fairly capable front-end developer and don't have any issue banging out a CSS animation or following some good JS libraries documentation, but I felt like I was sitting on my hands in the code editor in Framer.

This could easily by my fault for not knowing more JavaScript, but as someone who's responsible for the architecture, the interface look and feel, and the animations, I simply didn't have time to dig deeply into all of the code possibilities within the app, so I went back to InVision Studio to create the detailed animations that I knew would be possible with code, I just wasn't ready to learn the new syntax for everything.

I'm ranting more on Framer in this post because it's the tool I'm coming fresh out of.

## Conclusion
I'm honestly thrilled at this current moment to move out using Framer everyday for the last 4 months, and go back to another tool that is both incredibly fast and incredibly functional. Right now that tool for me is Figma. 

Now, as I head into full-time production on [Shift Nudge](https://shiftnudge.com)—an interface design course—I'll be working primarily in Figma, but exploring features in all of the other design tools mentioned here as well.

If you'd like to continue the design tool conversation, hit me up on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mds). Happy designing my friends.

# Tiiny

![tiiny](/content/images/2014/Sep/tiiny.png)

[Tiiny](http://tiiny.com) is an app that I've been using the last few days since it came out. The premise is simple.

>Share tiny little photos (and videos) that disappear after 24 hours.

It's a neat concept that seems to remove unspoken barriers that build up naturally in any other *"social network."* Ugh, hate that phrase. No we don't need yet another social network, but to me, for now at least, this feels like something different.

Here's more context from Kevin Rose via Product Hunt:

>"Tiiny is quick way to share little (212x212) photos and videos with friends. But why? At first glance the idea of tiny pictures (that you can’t enlarge) sounds ridiculous. The world doesn’t need yet another photo sharing app. Even if it did, why tiny photos? Let me explain. 

>When you have a small disposable photo you relax a little. All of a sudden it’s not about applying filters or making sure you get the perfect pose, it’s about rapidly blasting out a handful of fun pics and videos instantaneously. Sharing those little moments in your life that get lost. Those moments that are silly, fleeting, imperfect. Those snippets of life that represent our unguarded, most expressive selves."

Pretty interesting idea.

When you log into the app via Twitter, the app auto-follows all of the same folks you already follow on Twitter, creating an instant feed for you.

Chances are you're familiar with the names and faces from your Twitter feed, so Tiiny becomes a tiny video extension of the same people doing random things. Silly things. Things you wouldn't normally see them posting, but in this context, the pressure is low and it reveals a new online layer of everyday life.

It's made of three sections: the popular feed, the main grid, and your profile.

![tiiny screens](/content/images/2014/Sep/tiiny_screens.png)

The popular feed, as it is, is mostly videos from Kevin Rose and a handful of others, due to the amount of Twitter followers they started Tiiny with.

Perhaps this feed will get a batch of different people as more people join or maybe it will evolve more into an *Explore-like* section, ala Instagram, over time to become slightly more interesting.

The main grid is where the magic happens. The always-on camera is ready to snap a pic or video with the quick tap of a finger, so be careful where you're pointing your camera. All of the tiny squares are nestled tightly together creating a fun and silly vibe amongst the Tiiny collective.

The profile shows a small snippet of follow counts with some notifications in a list below. The notification badge is a number with a heart and is so much more fun and refreshing than that little red dot with a number that every other app uses.

[Marc](http://twitter.com/hemeon) did an great job with the design and wrote a super [bang-up article](https://medium.com/@hemeon/the-making-of-tiiny-60b527757997) on the whole design process. Likewise, [Sam](http://twitter.com/soffes) and gang did a great job with the iOS dev on what I can only imagine was a really interesting challenge due to the shear volume of videos playing at once.

Tiiny isn't for everyone and who knows how long people will feel compelled to keep making tiny videos, but for now, it's fun and you should totally [try it out](http://tiiny.com).

# Tools Don't Matter

![workshop](/content/images/2014/Jun/1280px_19th_century_work_bench_with_many_tools__Auckland___0858.jpg)

Which piece of software should you use for interface design?

There are many good answers and opinions about this question, but the bottom line is...

You should use **the one that yields the best results.** Although this *is* the one true answer, there is a lot packed into a phrase like that. *Best results* can mean many different things to many different people so let's break it down.

When I say *best results*, here is what I'm thinking in order of importance:

1. I can be extremely fast and efficient with the software
2. I can organize design assets in a very cohesive manner
3. The output makes sense for my project and my team

## Speed and Efficiency
The number one priority when using a piece of software should be yourself. You are the the most important part of the equation. This may seem vain on the surface, but think about it. As a professional designer, you're spending the majority of your productive day using a specific design tool or tools.

That tool needs to be high quality and your ability to wield the tool should be great. You should be able to bend the tool at your will to achieve the results required for the design task at hand.

Talking with fellow designers and peers can be helpful to inform your decision, but should never be the deciding factor. Allow advice from others to help you validate options, but make your decision on what you feel is right for you.

I bought Sketch 3 a few months ago because of Mark Jardine's [tweet](https://twitter.com/markjardine/status/455758586434449408), but haven't abandoned my years of design and muscle memory building in Photoshop and Illustrator just because someone I respect as a designer is using it as their primary tool.

A carpenter isn't going to choose a trendy hammer solely because it's new and exciting. He will choose the hammer he is most comfortable with, the one he can successfully and solidly drive a rigid nail into the grain of a piece of wood.

What matters in his situation is not the hammer or the tool being used, but rather the rigidity of the joint between nail and wood, the straightness of the nail, the flushness of the nailhead with the surface of the board with a as little damage to the wood as possible.

The efficient carpenter relies on his muscle memory to strike a tiny piece of metal over and over without smashing his fingers into a bloody pulp. This dangerous feat becomes a simple habit once the steps required have become rutted in his [basil ganglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglia), the part of the brain that stores habits and routines.

The same is true for a designer. You draw shapes and text on the screen and move it all around over and over until you've thought through each piece of the puzzle. The quicker you're able to master the software the quicker you can get to your end result. The software becomes a mere triviality between your initial desires and the final outcome of your design.

As you master the software, it essentially disappears deep into the brain, the same part that allows the seasoned carpenter to successfully strike his nail over and over with as little effort as possible. The software becomes an extension of your body. Scratching your arm takes little cognitive effort and over time, neither does drawing shapes and moving them around.

## Organized and Cohesive
Second to speed comes organization. The software you use should allow you to organize easily as you go. I've found that if I'm intentional about organization while I'm designing, the design itself improves.

Naming things and grouping things are very much a part of the design process, so having tidy and organized files   often go hand in hand with nicely executed design. My design process now has file organization and naming conventions deeply intertwined at a fundamental level.

I don't think about it, I just do it. As my understanding of the software increases, it gets out of my way and lets me design instead of fiddling around with the software.

![charlie waite's layers](/content/images/2014/Jun/layers_btns_5.png)

It's no coincidence that [Charlie Waite's Photoshop layers](http://focuslabllc.com/journal/layers-theyre-not-just-in-cakes) (above) are just as beautifully organized as his [designs](http://dribbble.com/charliewaite) are executed.

Are your layers, files, artboards, etc. properly ordered and named? Do things make sense to you if you visit your source file a week later or are things a total cluster?                                 

## Logical Output
This one can be tricky and very contextual based on the goals of your project, your team, and your personal preferences. Essentially, once you've designed an interface, whether it's a wireframe or a polished design, you'll want to either present it or produce it.

Presentation requires static screens or components to be exportable and viewable without the need to access or open the source files. This might be a list of .jpgs in a Dropbox folder or a consolidated .pdf of the same images. No matter your exact file needs, each software will have its own method of exporting and it should suit your workflow as well and make sense for the people who'll be viewing your work.

A production team will benefit from the presentation documents as a point of reference, but will typically require more than a static comp. Again this depends highly on your project and team, but you need to know if the source files or their output will work for what you or your developers need.

## Final Thoughts
Analyze your problem before you start swinging a hammer. We as designers and developers have many tools at our disposal and should make it a priority to become familiar with their abilities and limitations.

Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch all have unique features to themselves as well as unique boundaries. Find the one that achieves the best results for you and use it.

I've been using Photoshop and [Illustrator](/aiux) for over a decade, so it wouldn't make sense to quit them cold turkey and move completely over to Sketch.

>Note: I did _eventually_ move away from these tools for UI design and wireframing between 2014–2019 in favor of Sketch and Figma. 

Instead, I continue to use the appropriate tool for maximum speed, organization, and output. My objectives extend (and your's should too) far beyond which piece of software I'm fiddling around with at the moment. 

Do your work well with the tools you know, but make time on the side to pick up new skills and new knowledge with new software.

### Update 2015
Since originally writing this article, I'm still a diehard Illustrator fan [for all UX design](/aiux), but I *have* pretty much switched to Sketch for all of my UI design, though I still use Photoshop on a regular basis for editing photos, creating Dribbble shots and such. 

### Update 2019
Wow, have 5 years really already passed since writing this original article? Crazy. I recently saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/MengTo/status/1151660300816568322) by Meng To and then [this one](https://twitter.com/DannPetty/status/1151609907868766209) by Dann Petty a little later and started thinking more about tools. 

Even in the last week of work, I've used Photoshop (for photo editing), Sketch for some Magic Mirror mockup work, Framer X for an entire large scale enterprise project, and Figma for additional UI screens and icon design. I've also been deep in InVision Studio and a little in XD doing some UI animations for the same project. 

The tool that's bringing me the most joy right now is Figma. It's a treat to work with, super fast, highly functional, and just plain fun to work in. I consider myself Team Figma™ at the moment, but in the next 5 years... who knows?

# Understanding Vector Shapes in Illustrator

![sign up main image](/content/images/2014/Apr/mds_sign_up_main.png)

When I posted ["Wireframing with Illustrator and InDesign"](http://mattdsmith.com/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/), several people asked about my Illustrator techniques. The simple truth is that I've used Illustrator a lot over the past decade and have learned a quick key for virtually everything I produce, whether it's logos, wireframes, or full-fledged interface designs. If there aren't quick keys for some frequently performed task, I will often create my own.

If you're new to Illustrator, don't fret. I'm starting this post at the beginning, so even if your goal is not to get blazing fast, you'll still get a solid understanding of the basics.

---

RANDOM PRINT SHOP SOMEWHERE IN SOUTHEAST GEORGIA - DAY (2000)

"Black magic!" I thought to myself, as I witnessed for the first time, someone manipulating vector shapes in Adobe Illustrator.  I was a freshman in college and visited a print shop to get a sticker made for the top of my white Ford Mustang's windshield. I'm embarrassed to admit that the sticker was designed to stretch across the entire width and read "Xtreme Customs." At least I didn't go for the "*customz*" spelling, but unfortunately this *was* the genius slogan that a group of friends and myself agreed upon as the name of our vehicle clique.

I designed the sticker in MS Paint like a total boss, but of course, the resolution was much too low to be stretched across the windshield of a vehicle. So the guy at the print shop scanned in my sad print out of what I thought was an incredible logotype and pulled it up in Illustrator. He began razzling and dazzling me with his fancy bézier curves and handlebar tweaking techniques. I didn't even know what type of software was capable of producing such awesomeness, let alone that I would one day use it for myself.

I remember the smell of all that fresh new plastic as he swiftly vectorized my bitmap printout and sent it to his giant plotter.

---

## Today's Syllabus
1. Understanding Vector Shapes
2. Selection and Direct Selection Tools
3. Drawing Rectangles and Circles
4. Basic Bézier Curve Modification
5. Real World Use Case - iPhone Sign Up Screen

## Understanding Vector Shapes
Before we jump in too deep, you need to have a basic understanding of vector shapes, points, paths, *and* the tools used to manipulate them.

First, we're going to draw a square in Illustrator. To do this, hit the `M` key on your keyboard. This is the quick key for selecting the rectangle tool. If you're going to use Illustrator and want to get fast and furious with it, you **must** learn this quick key along with all of the others I subsequently mention. Don't you dare go clicking on that tool panel without trying to remember the quick key first.

Alright, now that the rectangle tool is selected with the `M` key, you have two options for drawing a rectangle.

![illustrator square](/content/images/2014/Apr/rectangle_tool.png)

The first: Click and drag on the canvas while holding the `shift key` to maintain 1:1 proportions. Release your mouse button when you're happy with the size of your square.

![clicking and dragging to create a square](/content/images/2014/Apr/square.png)

The second: Click once anywhere on the canvas. Don't drag. This will open a dialog box where you can enter dimensions for your shape. This is particularly helpful if you are creating buttons for an interface that have a common height. Enter 300 x 300 and watch your shape automatically appear. 

![clicking to create a square](/content/images/2014/Apr/draw_square_click.png)

Now that the shape is drawn, let's analyze it a bit. Press the `A` key on your keyboard to select the `Direct Selection` tool. I'll cover this tool in a moment, but for now you can see that there are four blue squares in each corner of the shape with a tiny line connecting them all. The tiny blue squares are called anchors and the connecting lines are called paths.

![anchors and paths](/content/images/2014/Apr/300x300-1.png)

## Selection Tool
Once you've drawn the shape, you'll notice that the `rectangle tool` is still selected. Chances are high that you'll want to move that square somewhere, even if it's just a few pixels. Hit the `V` key on your keyboard to quickly change from the `Rectangle Tool` to the `Selection Tool.` This is not an optional shortcut for you to learn. You **must** use this quick key if you want to get fast with Illustrator.

The `Selection Tool` selects an entire vector object. Now that it's selected, you can move your square around a bit to get a feel for it.


### Resizing
The selection tool can also be used to transform a shape's height and width. Move your mouse over the corner anchor point of the object's bounding box until your mouse cursor changes from the pointer to the expand icon. Hold shift to maintain proportions while scaling the shape. You can also hold option to scale the shape from the center as opposed to a corner.

If the bounding box isn't showing for you hit `cmd+shift+B` to show it. This is the same as choosing `View > Show Bounding Box` from the menu bar. 

You can also hover the middle section of the bounding box to stretch a shape in one direction. 

As a general rule, I only use the `Selection Tool` to stretch large simple shapes like rectangles, circles, etc. When you get further into more intricate design the `Direction Selection Tool` is most often preferable.

### Changing the Color
In the bottom of the tool panel you'll see a fill and stroke color swatch. The fill is on the left and the stroke is on the right. Fill refers to the solid color of the shape, whereas stroke refers to the line around the shape. 

Any shape you create can have both a fill and stroke, one or the other, or neither. With the rectangle selected you can click the small arrow to reverse the fill and stroke, choose additional colors, etc.

![rectangle with black stroke](/content/images/2014/Apr/rect_stroke.png)

![rectangle with black fill](/content/images/2014/Apr/rec_fill.png)

All vector shapes, including text, in Illustrator have fill and stroke properties.

## Direct Selection Tool
The `Direct Selection Tool` selects an individual element of a vector object. This allows you to isolate an anchor point and manipulate it separate from the others. The quick key for `Direct Selection` is `A` and yes, you must learn and use this quick key.

>Pro Tip: Hover your mouse over any of the tools to see the quick key for that specific tool. For example, `Direct Selection (A)` will appear when you hover the `Direct Selection` tool in the tool panel.

You can select anchor points in a shape by clicking on them directly *or* drawing a faux shape around them, much like you would move folders around on your desktop.

The direct selection tool will change slightly when you hover directly over an anchor point. The anchor point will also change into a larger version of itself. See below.

![clicking an anchor point](/content/images/2014/Apr/selecting_anchor-1.png)

With this method we can manipulate the square by selecting the anchor point and dragging it in any direction.

![dragging an anchor point](/content/images/2014/Apr/dragging_anchor-1.png)

### Selecting Multiple Anchors
You can select multiple anchor points as well, using the same technique. Once you've clicked one anchor point, hold the shift key to select a second one at the same time. With both anchor points selected you can manipulate them simultaneously.

Let's say we want to skew our square. We can either shift-click the top two anchor points or draw a selection around them. Drawing a selection around your anchor points is typically a faster technique.

![selecting two anchor points](/content/images/2014/Apr/selecting_two_anchors-1.png)

![dragging two anchor points](/content/images/2014/May/two_anchor_points_dragged.png)

>Pro Tip: With any object or anchor point selected you can move it 1px at a time with your keyboard arrow keys or 10px at a time by holding `shift + any arrow key`

## Bézier Curves
To get a handle on the concept of bézier curves check out these gifs below. [Taken from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bézier_curve#Constructing_B.C3.A9zier_curves)

![curve 1](/content/images/2014/Apr/240px_Bezier_1_big.gif)

![curve 2](/content/images/2014/Apr/240px_Bezier_2_big.gif)

![curve 3](/content/images/2014/Apr/240px_Bezier_3_big.gif)

![curve 4](/content/images/2014/Apr/240px_Bezier_4_big.gif)

The insanely awesome gifs show what's happening with those handle bars that extend from a vector shapes anchor points. To simply this concept we can examine a circle or ellipse shape.

To select the `Ellipse Tool` hit the `L` key on your keyboard. The tool is otherwise hidden behind the `Rectangle Tool (M)` in the tool panel. Same as before with the square, you can click an drag on the canvas to create a circle shape.

![drawing a circle](/content/images/2014/Apr/drawing_circle-1.png)

Optionally, you can click once on the canvas to bring up the Ellipse panel to enter in height and width dimensions. 

![creating a circle](/content/images/2014/Apr/quick_circle-1.png)

Once you've drawn a circle on the canvas, hit the `A` key to bring up your `Direct Selection` tool. Now draw a selection around one or more of the anchor points.

![circle showing handlebars](/content/images/2014/Apr/circle_handlebars-1.png)

This will show the handlebars extending from the anchor points. Without those handlebars, this circle shape would be a diamond. The length of the handlebar determines the shape of the path.

![circle and diamond](/content/images/2014/Apr/circle_transformed_diamond-1.png)

Now if you want to manipulate the handlebar of the anchor to change the curve of a path, there are two ways to do it. The first is the `Direct Selection (A)` tool. Use this tool by selecting an anchor point to reveal its handlebars and selecting the handlebar of your choice to move around. This technique will move both handlebars on each side of the anchor, affecting the path equally on both sides as well.

![handlebar moving around](/content/images/2014/Apr/circle_manipulate_handlebars-1.png)

The second way to manipulate an anchor point's handlebar is by using the `Pen Tool (P)`. Using the `Direct Selection Tool (A)`, select one of the anchor points, then select the `Pen Tool` by hitting `P` on the keyboard.

If you hover an anchor point with the pen tool selected you will notice a `-` appear beside the pen tool icon signifying subtraction. Clicking will remove that anchor point and you'll see the path change based on the remaining anchors.

![anchor point removed from circle](/content/images/2014/Apr/anchor_removed.png)

To manipulate the path without removing the anchor point, hold the `Option` key (while the `Pen Tool` is selected). This will change the cursor from the pen icon to an angled `/\` icon. With this alternative tool you can grab the point on the end of the handlebar and manipulate it in isolation. This will only modify the path on one side of the anchor point, leaving the other side unchanged.

![single handlebar changed](/content/images/2014/Apr/single_anchor.png)

You can also redraw both handlebars of a single anchor point with the alternate `/\` tool.

While holding `option` with the `Pen Tool (P)` selected, you can click and hold on top of an anchor point and slowly drag in any direction to redraw new handlebars for that point.

![redrawing new points](/content/images/2014/Apr/redrawing_handlebar.png)

## Real World Use
Let's say you want to create a wireframe for an iPhone app's Sign Up screen. Alrighty, let's do that using what you just learned about rectangles, circles and the pen tool.

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/91539589" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Here are the steps I performed to create the screen shown in the video above.**

1. Create a new document by hitting `command+n`.
2. Enter 640x1136 (Screen size for iPhone 5 and greater)
3. Select the `Rectangle Tool (M)` by hitting the quick key, `M`.
4. Click once anywhere on the canvas.
5. Enter 640x1136 to create a full size background shape.
6. Align the shape with the artboard by clicking and dragging or by using the align tool. (I'll cover this tool in another post.)
7. Click once anywhere on the canvas.
8. Enter 640x128 (Size of a standard iOS 7 header, including the status bar)
9. Manually position the header at the top left of the artboard, or by using the align tool. 
10. Hit the `T` key to select the `Type Tool`.
11. Click anywhere on the canvas and type "Sign Up".
12. Command + click anywhere on the canvas away from the text to exit the type input. 
13. Hit the `V` key to change to the `Selection Tool.`
14. Select the "Sign Up" text and hit `command+shift+C` to center the text.
15. Drag the "Sign Up" text to the center of the header shape.
16. Hit the `L` key to select the `Ellipse Tool`. 
17. Click anywhere on the canvas. Enter 120x120.
18. Hit the `V` key to select the `Selection Tool`.
19. Click and drag the circle just below the header.
20. Adjust the fill to the be transparent and the stroke to have a slightly darker stroke color than the fill. You can give the stroke a dotted line by selecting `Dashed Line` in the stroke panel.
21. Now hit `M` and click anywhere on the canvas.
22. Enter 8x48 to draw a rectangle.
Hit `V` to change to the `Selection Tool`. 
Select the 8x48 rectangle and hit `command+c` then `command+shift+v` to copy and paste in place. (command+v will paste in the center of your screen)
23. With the top 8x48 rectangle selected, hover the corner of the bounding box until the cursor changes to the rotate icon.
24. Holding shift, rotate the new 8x48 shape 90º.
25. Shift+click the vertical 8x48 so both smaller rectangles are selected at the same time.
26. Hit `command+g` to group these shapes together. (Side note: `command+shift+g` while ungroup objects.
27. Hit `V` and drag the " + " to the center of your 120x120 circle.
28. With the " + " selected, shift+click the circle and hit `command+g` to group these items. 
29. Hit the `M` key for the `Rectangle Tool`.
30. Click anywhere on the canvas. Enter 500x100.
31. Hit the `T` key for the `Type Tool`. Click anywhere and type "Name"
32. Hit `command+return` to exit type input mode or `command+click` anywhere on the canvas.
33. Hit `V` for the `Selection Tool`. Grab the "Name" type and position it in the 500x100 rectangle as placeholder text.
34. Select both the 500x100 rectangle and the type and hit `command+g` to group those objects.
35. With the new group selected. Click and `option+drag` the group below the original input field, holding the shift key to maintain a 90º axis. When you `option+drag` it creates a copy of the selected object.
36. Double click on the copied "Name" to enter the text field. Type "Email"
37. Hit `M` for the `Rectangle Tool` and click anywhere on the canvas. Enter 500x100.
38. This will be a button, so make it blue (for now). To do this hit `V`, select the button. Now make sure the fill swatch is in the foreground above the stroke swatch. Go to your color palette and choose blue.![fill stroke and color swatch](/content/images/2014/Apr/fill_stroke.png)
39. Position the button just below the "Email` input field.
40. Hit `M`, click on the canvas and enter 15x15.
41. Hit `A` to select the `Direct Selection Tool`. Click one of the anchor points on the small square and hit `Delete`. Now you have an equilateral triangle instead of a square.
42. Hit `V` and select the triangle, if it's not already selected.
43. Position the triangle in the center of the blue button.
44. Hover near one of the corners until you see `Selection Tool` arrow change into the small rotate icon.
45. Hold shift to maintain angle constraints and rotate 45º.
46. With the rotated triangle selected, choose a transparent fill color (the white swatch with the red slash).
47. Now select the stroke selection in the `tool panel` to bring stroke to the foreground above the fill.
48. Choose white as the stroke color.
49. From the stroke panel, choose 2px. 
50. In the same stroke panel, choose rounded caps and rounded corners.![rounded caps and corners](/content/images/2014/Apr/stroke.png)

51. Hit `L` for the `Ellipse Tool`, click anywhere, enter 50x50.
52. With the small circle selected, hit `I` to select the `Eyedropper Tool`. 
53. Click the small arrow with the eyedropper, while the circle is selected. This will give the circle the same fill and stroke properties and the arrow.
54. Hit `V` to select the arrow and circle, now position them in the center of the blue button.
55. Hit `M` for the `Rectangle Tool`, click anywhere, and enter 640x432. This is the size of an iOS keyboard.
56. Position this keyboard shape in the bottom left of the canvas. This serves as reference for how your interface is positioned with the keyboard showing.
57. Now hit `L` for `Ellipse Tool`, click on the canvas, and enter 11x11. This is the size of the dot, which indicate phone signal strength.
58. Hit `V`, click the dot and give it a black fill with a transparent stroke.
59. Move the dot to the top left of the canvas.
60. With the dot selected, `option+drag` a copy of the dot just to the right of the original. 
61. Before hitting any other key or clicking anything else, hit `command+d` to duplicate your previous action. This short cut key is the jam.
62. Now you have three dots. Hit `command+d` twice more to give yourself a full five signal dots.
63. We're in a weak service area so let's select the last three dots and, in the tool panel, reverse the fill and stroke.
64. With the same stroked dots selected, change the stroke alignment to the center selection: `Align stroke to inside`![align stroke](/content/images/2014/Apr/align_stroke.png)
65. Now hit `T` for the `Type Tool`, click near the top and type 11:50 AM. 
66. In the character panel (`Window > Character Panel`) or `command+T`, change the font size to 23px.
67. Hit `V` and align the correct position at the top of the screen.
68. Last but not least, let's draw the battery shape. Hit `M` for the `Rectangle Tool`, click anywhere and enter 45x19.
69. Now change the shape from a black fill to a black stroke by reversing the fill and stroke in the bottom of the tool panel.
70. Choose `Align stroke to inside` from the stroke panel.
71. Hit `M` again, click, and enter 41X15. Choose a black fill and no stroke for this shape.
72. Hit `V`, select the smaller shape and position in centered within the batter outline.
73. If you're using Adobe Illustrator CC Version 17.1.0, you have the option to add rounded corners to your rectangle shapes, otherwise leave them square and I'll cover rounded corners in another tutorial.
74. Click or select your battery outline anchor points with the `Direct Selection Tool (A)` and enter 3px in the corner input at the top of the screen.![corner dialog](/content/images/2014/Apr/corners.png)
75. Now click the battery fill shape with the `Direct Selection Tool (A)` and enter 1.5px in the corner input.
76. Hit `M`, click anywhere, enter 3x7 for the battery cap shape.
77. Hit `A` for `Direct Selection` and select the two outermost anchor points on the opposite side of the battery.
78. With these anchors selected only, enter 2px in the corner input.
79. Hit `V`, select all of the battery pieces, and hit `command+g` to group the objects.
80. Position the battery group in the top left of the screen and you're done!

## Summary
Vector shapes in Illustrator may seem foreign and complex if you've never dealt with them before, but after a little practice you'll have the basics down in no time. Stick with rectangles and circles for a while as you think about creating basic interface bits. Force yourself to use the quick keys until you know them without thinking about it. You are essentially building muscle memory the same way you'd learn to type or play the guitar.

Continue ramping up your knowledge of Illustrator and learn tips and tricks to get super fast from both a thinking and design perspective in my new [AIUX series](/aiux).

# The Perfect Stool for Your Standing Desk

I've had a standing desk since 2013. I have no [ragrets](/content/images/2015/10/No-RAgrets-Tattoo-BIG.jpg). 

Standing gives you more energy, drains you less, **BUT** you can't stand all day. You need a stool to lean against, to sit on, to comfort your new standing position when your legs get tired.

I do a rough combo of 50% standing, 30% leaning, and 20% sitting. To switch things up, you need a stool.

[This is the stool you want](http://amzn.to/1LlTJHs). Don't bother messing around with some cheap crappy version. This one is adjustable and built like a tank. Just get it.

# Using an Illustrator Template

![aiux starter kit](/content/images/2016/03/aiux-starter-kit-1.svg)

When you get started on some new wireframes or flows, do you open a blank document and just start working?

That’s what I used to do. Most of the time I’d open an `.ai file` from a previous project and copy and paste whatever pieces I needed into my new file to give me a little jump start.

I did this for a long time, but it would never fail that I’d need to get things a little more organized with [artboards](/illustrator-artboards/) and what not.

Finally I decided that what I was doing over and over was completely inefficient. I could be using a starter template for all of my content maps, user flows, and even base starting points for my wireframes. 

I never wanted to do that because I’m not a huge fan of gigantic UI kits reused over and over for different projects.

**Doing this kills creativity in a big way**. Reusing extremely common elements is one thing, but entire designs results in design inbreeding. Gross.

I took the most common element from every one of my UX design projects. Things that I would either forgot to set up from the beginning and others that I’d have to dig up from some old file.

- Global Swatches
- Document Title Tag
- Hierarchical Content Map
- User Story and Flow Template
- Responsive Screens for Wireframing


## Global Swatches
![global swatches](/content/images/2016/03/swatches-1.svg)

This is one of Illustrator’s super powers. If you stick with using global swatches for everything, you can change ALL instances of that color at anytime.

This is how good programming is done with proper variable usage. Why not design that way too?

## Document Title Tag
![document title tag](/content/images/2016/03/mds-tag-1.svg)

This gives anyone viewing our final document, information about the project, the file, who created it, and what version it is. 

This tag is converted to a symbol so that every instance is the same. You can pop your logo in there and update the information for any new project.

## Hierarchical Content Map
![content map](/content/images/2016/03/content-map-1.svg)

Virtually every project needs to have everything listed out in an organized fashion. This helps to both visual and prioritize all of the content and features.

I’ve been creating these over and over from scratch. Now I just use this template.

## User Story and Flow Template
![user story and flow](/content/images/2016/03/user-flow-2.svg)

It’s a toss up whether or not I use this exact page for every project, but it’s still pretty common.

It can really help to write a quick little story about the person you’re designing for, as well as map out a flow from beginning to end of them using your product.


## Responsive Screens for Wireframing
![responsive screens](/content/images/2016/03/responsive-devices-1.svg)

These are pretty straightforward. 99% of the time, I design wireframes with small mobile-first components, and plot those out against larger devices to get an idea for how the content will play together across the ever-so-multi-deviced-interwebs.

All of this comes together in one glorious template, you can pull up as a starting point for each of your new projects.

![ait](/content/images/2016/03/ait.png)

Then in an actual project it might end up looking something like this...

![aiux starts kit project](/content/images/2016/03/aiux-sk-eg1.png)

or this...

![aiux starts kit project](/content/images/2016/03/aiux-sk-eg2.png)

## Usage
Ok, hopefully I’ve convinced you that using this file will shave  hours and hours off of your everyday workflow with Illustrator.

To use the template, download it, and place it in the following location:

`Applications > Adobe Illustrator > Cool Extras > en_US > Templates > aiux-template.ait` 

![ait location](/content/images/2016/03/ait-location.png)

^ Don't you love the `Cool Extras` folder that Adobe put in there. 😏

Once that's in place, go to `Illustrator > File > New From Template...` and you should see it as an option.

With things organized like this, I can easily send out files I produced on any given day. I do this for a few reasons:

1. You can add/edit/remove items from a link-shared Dropbox folder. If you send the email and forgot to add something or spot a mistake, you can throw updated files in the dropbox folder and it's no big deal.
2. Respect for others' inboxes. Nobody wants to download a bunch of big image files. Why not let them stay nestled softly in the cloud?

Sometimes for bigger projects, sending a direct link everytime can get a little annoying– clients digging through old emails to grab dropbox links, etc. In these situations, I'll restructure my `Review` folder to be a little more descriptive, adding a few layers of heirarchy, so things are easier to find, while still maintaining dated folders at the lowest level.

---

![more descriptive review folder](/content/images/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-05-at-11-50-02-AM.png)

---

With this in place I can copy the link from the main `Review` folder at the highest level and put it into an html file with a javascript redirect. Or even easier, use a URL shortener. The only downside is that you can't always customize the full URL with those.

---

![dropbox link from main review folder](/content/images/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-05-at-11-04-35-AM.png)

---

With this link copied, I can create a custom folder on my website, upload the HTML file with the necessary tweaks, and have a solid memorable `Review` link for the client to have and hold like a little security blanket.

Here's a simple JS redirect in an HTML file.

---

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mds/05bc536f2ba41d0b543f.js"></script>

---

Once you create a file like this, you can upload it to your server so you have something like [http://mysweetstudio.com/awesomeclient/review](#) that redirects to your root level `Review` folder.

The client can bookmark the link and always have access. Doing this in addition to emailing direct dropbox links to dated folders has worked really well for me.

# Using Mojave Dark Mode On Only the Menu Bar and Dock

Mojave Dark Mode™ left me a little underwhelmed. I really wanted to like the dark interface, but I just don't. Thanks to[ @st8rmi](https://twitter.com/st8rmi)'s tweet and [this post](https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/only-dark-menu-bar-dock-mojave/), I found a better way.

---

### Follow these steps
1. System Preferences > General > Appearance: Light
2. In Terminal, paste `defaults write -g NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool Yes` and hit `return`
3. Go to  > Log Out...
4. Log back in
5. System Preferences > General > Appearance: Dark
6. Boom. Dark mode only on the menu bar and dock. 

**Bonus**: Set your desktop background to `#171717` to match the dark menu bar. 

---

If you want to reverse this, I'm assuming you'd just change `defaults write -g NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool No`, but honestly why would you wanna go back?

# Nucleo, the Smartest Set of Icons for Designers and Developers

![nucleo icon app](/content/images/2015/08/nucleo-app.png)

I've been using [Nucleo](https://nucleoapp.com/?ref=mds) for the last couple of weeks for a few different projects, and I must say it's quite impressive. The icon libary is pretty extensive for being a relatively new app and Sebastiano and team are adding more and more icons pretty regularly. You can check out the [Nucleo Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/nucleo) page to get a feel for what's available.

You can search for specific icons, choose outlined or solid mode, and export them as .pngs or .svg. Super simple.

![nucleo app pricing](/content/images/2015/08/nucleo-pricing.png)

You can pay a flat fee of $49 for a year or $99 for *unlimited* access. I regularly design my own icons, but there are lots of times I just need quick access to some and Nucleo is becoming a go to for me.

------------------------------
# Using Stuff

I use a lot of stuff. This is not an exhaustive list, but contains the most used items from my day to day life.

## Work

- **13” Retina MacBook Pro** with 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16 GB of RAM. My previous machine was a 13” MacBook Air. While I really liked the Air, there’s no way I could go back to a non-retina screen. It makes my big Apple monitor seem crappy. Which leads me to…
- **27” Apple Cinema Display**. I really love this monitor especially when I’m designing a lot of wireframes or UI screens. I do still find myself drifting back to the retina screen of my laptop though because of its crispy goodness.
- **Apple Bluetooth Keyboard and Trackpad**. These are my go-to accessories when using the cinema display. I was always hesitant about the smaller keyboard with no num-pad, but ever since they released the version that connects via Thunderbolt, I was sold. Also the trackpad might seem weird at first to design with, but now I’m all in. I used a magic mouse prior to the trackpad and sometimes miss it. I’ve *never* used a Wacom for design.

### Software
- I use iAwriter to start off any text-based idea. I love the simplicity.
- I’m a die hard **Adobe Illustrator** user for UX design. You can’t beat it for logo and icon design either. If you want to see how I use if for big UX projects, [check out this email series](http://learnaiux.com). It’s hard to get super precise in Illustrator with individual pixels and that makes it great for quick wireframing.
- I use and love Sketch for all things UI design. I switched to Sketch from Photoshop in 2013 and haven’t looked back. It’s highly geared for pixel precision, which is perfect for interfaces.
- For UI animation, I use Adobe Animate (formerly Flash). I started out in the web using Flash and that’s my primary reason for sticking with it. After Effects might be a better tool in the long run, but I haven’t felt enough pain with Animate to learn AE better.
- Lightroom for photography.
- Sublime Text for coding. Sometimes CodeKit to compile Sass.
- I’ve used Transmit since the early 2000s as my FTP software of choice. I also used to use Coda before I got better at development.
- Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing. Speaking of, [check out my vlog](/vlogging).
- Glyphs for type design. Thanks to [Mattox](http://fortfoundry.com), my studio mate for showing me the ropes. 
- Things for tracking to-dos. I don’t have a hard core methodology  that I follow, but when I want to get organized I start with Things.
- If Things isn’t keeping me on track with what I need to plan and do for any given project, I’ll create spreadsheets with Numbers or Google Sheets. 
- I use Safari as my web browser of choice. If I’m doing web development I use Chrome because the inspector is 10x better.
- Spotify helps keep me focused during work, sometimes.

>Ok, I got tired of writing right about here because it's kind of monotonous to write about the things I use day in and day out. I do realize that some of this maybe novel and interesting to others though, so I **will** continue. Just not right this very moment. Consider this a beta blog post.

### Online Services
Yep, I use these.

### Camera 
I have two different, but very awesome cameras

## Personal
I'd like to go beyond the cliched "here's all the stuff I work with" post and go even more personal.

### Exercise
I like cycling, running, and strength training. I'll write more about each soon and link to some of my favorite stuff.

### Clothes
Links to stuff coming soon.

### Style
Hmm, maybe more links. Favorite hair products, etc. I just don't know.

### Misc
In case I come across something random that doesn't fit into the other categories. Again links coming soon.

If you're curious about the stuff I left out, leave a comment below to encourage me to keep writing about them.

# Vectorize a Logo Using Simple Shapes in Illustrator

If you've been a designer for longer than a minute, you've no doubt ran into a situation where you need the client's logo for something you're working on. Do seek out the official logo whenever you can, especially if it's super brand specific, but if it's for something like I'm currently working on (high level wireframes) then by all means, save yourself the time it takes to write the email and bust a vector version for yourself.

Some logos are more complex than others, but a lot of the really good ones are very simple. If you look at them long enough and study the geometry, you can start to see the patterns of how they were created. Circles, squares, diamonds, etc. all shapes that are used in part to create certain types of logos.

Showing concentric circles around a logo design gets a bad rep, but perhaps it's because the critics don't understand how they are used by some designers to create the finished product.

For example, I used 5 circles as the base for my *mds* logo. See below.

![mds logo](/content/images/2014/12/mds-logo-01.png)

Check out the video below to get a walkthrough of recreating a client logo with simple vector shapes.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/r3Z6XXTJRD8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Super Secret Logo Trick
You can also do a google search for *your client name* and *pdf* to see if any documents with their vector logo exist online. You can check to see if it's vector by looking at the document, zooming in, and seeing if the quality is still sharp.

Once you've found it, download the pdf and open it using Illustrator. You can then use the direct select tool `A` to cut it out of the document and paste it into a new one. Voila!

# The Garmin Forerunner 235

![garmin forerunner charging](/content/images/2017/01/garmin-forerunner-235-charging.jpg)

[The Garmin Forerunner 235](http://amzn.to/2iy6oAN) is my current watch.

---

I bought it in October 2016, just after I finished my [first half marathon](/running).

I considered both the FitBit Surge and an Apple Watch beforehand. But after more research I decided I didn't want a watch with a bunch of apps on it. I just wanted GPS to track my runs and bike rides.

Then, I went to Best Buy because I wanted to buy it immediately and the closest store to my house that carried the FitBit was indeed Best Buy.

When I went into the store, I found the smartwatch section and was kind of underwhelmed by the look of the Fitbit Surge. 

I was a little disappointed trying to convince myself it actually looked better than I thought it did. You know, trying to psyche myself up about it.

But then I saw the Garmin section, and holy crap those were some sweet looking watches. Why hadn't I heard about these or even considered them before?

I almost bought one in that moment, but decided to go back home and do more research.

I watched videos, went to watch comparison sites, you name it.

I ultimately decided, obviously, to go with the [Garmin Forerunner 235](http://amzn.to/2iy6oAN).

Here are a few reasons why I love my watch

- It's got a big watch face
- The display is always on and doesn't turn off
- The battery lasts nearly a full week on one charge. Way better than most other smart watches.
- The band is super cozy
- You can make the face light or dark
- It tracks runs and bike rides with GPS and syncs with the Garmin iPhone app, which syncs to Strava. I've used [Strava for all of my running/riding](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2819943) for a few years and wanted a way to automate that.
- It doesn't look like a giant fitness tracker
- It lets me know if I've not moved much in the last hour or so, but in a subtle way
- I get push notifications to my watch from my phone if I choose. Sometimes it's nice and sometimes it's annoying.

# Why Wearing Black Can Actually Keep You Cooler

![jersey](/content/images/2014/Sep/Which_Jersey_Do_You_Prefer.png)

I'm working on some [cycling jersey designs](https://dribbble.com/shots/1735773-Which-Jersey-Do-You-Prefer?list=users&offset=0), which has prompted me to do a little research regarding color and heat intake. It's pretty common to hear that "wearing black makes you hotter." While that can be true if you are completely stationery, it can make you cooler if there is even slight wind.

Black does absorb heat from the sun at a faster pace than white, but black also absorbs the heat from your body as well. Throw a little wind into the mix and black is the better choice for wicking away the heat away from your core.

There are some interesting articles that go into more explanation.

>"White clothing reflects sunlight, but also reflects internal heat back towards your body, so the net effect under identical conditions is less cooling than if you wore black."

via [Straight Dope](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1886/does-black-clothing-keep-you-cooler)


>"If there's even a little wind, black clothing is the better choice for those who want to keep cool, like goths who understandably don't like sweating through their make-up. So find something black to wear this summer."

# What Do You Call Yourself?

"So, what do you do?" is the age old question that everyone seems to face on a regular basis. Be it conferences, weddings, family events, parties, church, and many other life events. Lots of people in our industry often feel conflicted about the answer they give.

![neil degrasse tyson](http://media.giphy.com/media/cwTtbmUwzPqx2/giphy.gif)

I've called myself lots of things over the years - Graphic Designer, Interactive Designer, Designer/Developer, UX/UI Designer, Art Director, Creative Director and more. But the thing is, I love doing business and UX strategy, wireframes, visual design, interactions, animations, development techniques, coding, etc. too. 

I've created my fair share of wireframes, but I don't call myself an information architect or user-experience designer. I've coded up lots of sites, but I don't call myself a web developer. I've created animations, interactions, page-transitions, etc. but don't call myself an interaction designer. I've made business plans for the future and mapped out product releases for my own products and other clients, but don't call myself a business consultant.

I am a designer and a problem solver. I design wireframes. I design logos. I design icons and user interfaces. I design websites and mobile apps. I --design-- write code. To me it's all design. Even coding is an art form in itself.

I'm not sure why we so desperately want to be "labeled" but it's true. We want to be called something. Dad. Son. Husband. Wife. Daughter. Mom. Designer. Developer. What do you call yourself?

# Wireframing With Illustrator and InDesign

<script type="text/javascript" async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

![wireframing with illustrator and indesign](/content/images/2014/Jan/wireframing_with_illustrator-2.jpg)

I design all of my wireframes in Illustrator. The main reason: I know how to use Illustrator extremely fast. Like seriously mind-bending fast. I don't use UI kits, ready made templates, I just open it up and start powering through ideas. Drawing all of my own buttons, icons, etc.

Illustrator starts off as my digital sketch board. For 95% of the things I wireframe, I start with mobile first. This constrains my designs to a tiny viewport and helps me go even faster.

<script async data-uid="e0f0df7ecf" src="https://f.convertkit.com/e0f0df7ecf/d3ed700a7f.js"></script>

</div>
</div>

## A Clean Slate
![new illustrator document](/content/images/2014/Jan/new_illustrator_document.png)

Ah, just look at that beauty up there. The possibilities are endless. And that's the problem. You need more focus, so we're gonna bring in a tiny rectangle to work with. Here is an iPhone outline that we'll use to get started. This helps frame the context for your wireframe designs. 

![iphone outline](/content/images/2014/Jan/iphone_outline.png)

Despite how cool all of those Dribbble wireframe and blueprint mashups look, don't be tempted by the forbidden fruit. That's not what wireframing is about. There is a balance. You want it to look good of course, but this is not a work of art, it's function over form at this point.

## A Dirty Slate
Here's an example of some screens I put together for a recent project. 

![big canvas with lots of screens](/content/images/2014/Jan/big_canvas.png)

You'll notice that it looks like someone vomited all over the canvas. Admittedly so, I let this one get out of hand for a while.

But no worries, it'll get fixed later. I start off by rapidly producing screen after screen in a linear fashion that tells a story. Then sit back, think through the flow, what I'm trying to accomplish, and decide if what I've created achieves the goal without unnecessary fluff.

![search wireframes](/content/images/2014/Jan/search.png)

Start off by creating one main document. *project-wireframes-v0.1* works great. As you move through more of the project, you will ultimately come to a point when you'd like to share your screens with someone else - client, coworker, your mom.

![multiple sections](/content/images/2014/Jan/multiple_sections.png)

## Organizing and Sectioning
This next step can be a little tedious at first, but with a little practice and elbow grease, you'll get it in no time. You're going to start creating chapters and individual pages. For example, *Search* might be it's own chapter that includes 10-15 screens. So the formatting would look like this:

**Chapter 01 - Search**

- 01.00.00 Search Landing
- 01.00.01 Search Landing Error
- 01.00.02 Search Landing Notification
- 01.01.00 Search Results
- 01.01.01 Search Results Selected
- 01.02.00 Search Result Quick View

The syntax I'm using is *Chapter.Screen.View*. In the above example, the first three bullets are all Chapter 01, Screen 00, and alternate views of that same screen. Whereas "Search Results" takes on a new screen, becoming 01.01.00. "Search Results Selected" might be 01.01.01. Make sense?

There is no rigid industry guideline that you need to follow here, it just needs to make sense for you and your project and the story that you're trying to tell. You will no doubt have to refactor and renumber sections as you go. That's just part of the process.

## Splitting up the Files
Now that you've got a basic number system in place, this is when we start saving each screen as its own individual .ai file. When you do this is totally up to you, but I like to design a fair amount of sections before getting to this point. In fact, the only reason you need to put your files in individual documents is for presentation purposes. So investors, clients, and others can make sense out of things.

With your large document open, copy and paste each numbered screen into its own new document. This will be our "paste" document. You want to make sure that each screen you save as a file is in the same position so it imports into InDesign without alignment issues. More on this in a bit.

Create some guidelines for your new paste document and position your screen accordingly.

![blank ai](/content/images/2014/Jan/paste_doc.png)

![pasted ai](/content/images/2014/Jan/pasted.png)

Now that things are nice and aligned, save your file as *01.00.00-screen-title-des*. Or, if you have another preferred naming convention go for it. I just recommend the numbering first so things are nice and tidy when viewing in the finder. Plus the addition of the *screen-title* and *desc* help you make sense of the file rather than the numbers alone, without needing to open it up.

![saved ai](/content/images/2014/Jan/saved.png)

Rinse and repeat this process for each section, until you end up with something like this.

![illustrator files in finder](/content/images/2014/Jan/ai_files.png)

## Fire up InDesign
I've created a basic template for organizing my illustrator files in InDesign.

1. Title
2. Project Overview
3. Table of Contents
4. Section Title
5. Screens
6. Repeat 4 & 5 as necessary
7. Revision History

![indesign template one](/content/images/2014/Jan/indesign.png)

For pages that have screens, just place the corresponding .ai file into location and fill in the information accordingly.

![placed files](/content/images/2014/Jan/placed_file.png)

To create new pages, just copy an existing one, replace the ai. file and update the info in the side bar. This is great for making edits, because the .ai files can be opened, edited and saved, which update automatically in your InDesign document.

You just need to update some info on the master pages for your project, as well as the Numbering & Section Option to suite your needs. (Right click on any page to do this.)

![numbers and sections 1](/content/images/2014/Jan/num_sec_1.png)

![numbers and sections 2](/content/images/2014/Jan/num_sec_2.png)

Once you've got everything in place, sections and table of contents updated, just hit cmd+e (or file > export) and save as a PDF.

![export](/content/images/2014/Jan/export.png)

![save as](/content/images/2014/Jan/save_as.png)

I've used this same template as a starting point for multiple clients. Every time, they've loved the structure and organization. It's a huge value add as a deliverable and helps presenations go more smoothly. 

## Your Moment of Glory
If you have a project that needs organized wireframes, I highly recommend this technique, especially if you are comfortable with Adobe products.

To help you along your path, I've bundled my Illustrator and Indesign Wireframing Starter Kit and have it available for FREE below. Take a look at the sample PDF to see how your project will look by using the source files.

### My current focus is [Shift Nudge](https://shiftnudge.com) and I'm currently unavailable for client work. 

---

## Services
I specialize in iOS and responsive web design. I enjoy branding, UX, and UI design. I like to create simplicity our of complexity and focus on crafting clean and usable experiences.

### UX
Whether you have an idea, a few sketches, initial mockups, or a full-blown product that needs to be refined, I can provide critical thinking about your app, its features, flows, screens, interactions, and more. With relentless curiosity, problem finding and problem solving is my specialty.

UX design services can consist of consultation, user and job story creation, wireframe screen designs, flows and interactions. Here's a look into my [UX process](http://mattdsmith.com/wireframing-with-illustrator-and-indesign/).

>Matt worked for my User Experience department at Macquarium on several projects and our largest account for over 2 years. To cut to the chase: he's an incredible talent. He has a rare ability to work quickly while producing exceptional results. Matt understands the intricacies of the web and mobile: interactive media that require expertise not just in look and feel, but the nuances of designing for behavior and motion. I would love to work with or hire him again.

### UI
It's very difficult to separate UX design from UI design. The two compliment each other and draw from one another. Even when crafting fully refined UI designs, I think through the experience and how certain decisions impact the product and a user's ability to be successful.

Every visual design decision I make has a fully informed thought process behind it. I don't provide ornamental design for design's sake, but rather thrive on providing form together with function.

>I've worked with Matt at three different companies, and it always goes exactly the same way: 1) Matt gets briefed on the design problem. 2) He grasps the problem instantly. 3) He proceeds to nail the problem with uncanny speed, precision, insight and style. Nobody knows how he does it.

### Branding
My graphic style is simplistic in nature. I strive to make memorable marks with iconic design. Whether it's [logos](https://dribbble.com/mds/tags/logo), app icons, or systematic iconography, I enjoy thinking through real world uses with a heavy design perspective.

>Matt's creative talent is the best I have seen. His attention to detail and phenomenal skill is best in class. His designs would always delight our clients and they always wanted him to work on their projects. Matt is a team player and would be an asset to any team.

### Consulting

<del>If your product needs outside perspective, I can review and provide a detailed design critique via Skype or in-person depending on your location, starting at $250/hr.</del>

<del>I like to get involved in projects early and help make strategic decisions so if you have something you're currently planning, get in touch!</del>

Maybe later, I'm currently unavailable. =)

>Matt worked for us doing some microsite concepting work for a major telecom. He was hired as a visual designer, but ending up also doing most of the wireframing work as well. At all times he was a professional, team player and the quality of the work was top notch. I would definitely hire Matt again.

>Matt is a rare and exceptional creative designer who brings a high level of innovation and professionalism to a project. In addition to being a fantastic craftsman in the realm of creative design, he is well versed in all aspects of interactive branding including the importance of user experience. While working with him at Razorfish, he impressed me with his ability to execute and articulate creative strategies in perfect deliverables with confidence. He has a friendly attitude, is approachable and down-to-earth. Matt is truly a valuable member of any project as a creative contributor or lead.

>I worked with Matt during my employment with both Macquarium and Engauge. What is my opinion of him? The creative work he delivered during his time contracting with Macquarium was fantastic! Regardless of the scope, whenever Matt set a deadline for a deliverable, he always hit the mark. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Matt; so much so that when I changed employers and joined Engauge, I sought him out on multiple occasions to pick up additional contract work on several accounts I was managing.

# The WOW Framework for Design

I've been teaching a design class at the University of GA this fall semester and it's stretched me a lot in terms of how to communicate the best way to approach a new project. I've currently got the students going through the process of writing user stories and designing user flows for their final projects. 

During this time I came up with a simple acronym to use as a framework for developing these user stories and flows.

![A series of dots progressing from left to right. The first dot being a W, the middle dot as Os, and the last dot as another W.](/content/images/2016/10/wow.svg)

If you can identify the **WOW** before you begin your project, it will make your life much easier by providing some necessary boundaries around your task. 

It doesn’t matter if you’re starting a new workout plan, writing a novel, or designing a new app. This WOW framework is essentially the “Google maps” directions for getting you where you need to go.

---

*Note: This framework is nothing "new" per se, it's just my own personal way of remembering things and connecting the dots. Perhaps you'll find it useful too.*

---


### W. number 1: Where are you?
The first **W** is all about developing a baseline* before you begin. If you’re designing for someone else you can also apply this to your targeted user with a pronoun modification—“Where are they?”

*Baseline, as defined by Merriam-Webster...

>1:  a line serving as a basis; especially :  one of known measure or position used (as in surveying or navigation) to calculate or locate something

>2:  either of the lines on a baseball field that lead from home plate to first base and third base and are extended into the outfield as foul lines

>3:  a boundary line at either end of a court (as in tennis or basketball)

>4: a usually initial set of critical observations or data used for comparison or a control

>5:  a starting point <the baseline of this discussion>

For this context we’ll use number 4, *an initial set of critical observations used for a control*.

If I told you to travel from your current location to San Diego, California you’d first need to know where you where traveling from.

Ask 1,000 people all over the world to travel to the same place, and their starting point will be much different. Some similarities will exist, but overall the path to their destination will be highly specific to their current location.

In the context of designing an app, information about the target user, *especially* about the problems they’re facing, is critical for developing a baseline for *where they are*. 

You need to know where someone **is** before you can direct them where to **go**. Asking as many questions as possible about the starting context is crucial for defining your first **W**.

### W. number 2: Where are you going (and why)?
Let's temporarily skip the **O.** and skip to the last **W.**

You can’t effectively plan a trip if you don’t know where you’re going. If you say, “I should go on a vacation.” You’d never go.

But if you said, *“I should go to San Diego the first week of November this year.”* You’d have a lot more to work with. You’d have a goal and a measurement for success. Did you make it to San Diego? The first week of November?

If you’re designing an app, a website, or anything else there has to be a goal. Every strategy and tactic should point towards this second **W**. It needs to be measurable, not some vague “tell people about the service.”

Goals that are not measurable, will not yield much success. Make it measurable.

As an extra bonus, make sure you have a very clear WHY as well, attached to this last W. The WHY will give you clarity and motivation when things get hard.

### O. Obstacles
Once you’ve defined your starting and ending *Where*, you can now identify the *Obstacles* of your journey.

The obstacles are critical pieces of the equation in your travels. Each one becomes a new mini-goal, pointing you towards your main target.

Beware of [Target Fixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_fixation).

>**Target fixation** is an attentional phenomenon observed in humans in which an individual becomes so focused on an observed object (be it a target or hazard) that they inadvertently increase their risk of colliding with the object. The phenomenon is most commonly associated with scenarios in which the observer is in control of a high-speed vehicle or other mode of transportation, such as race-car drivers, fighter pilots, motorcyclists, mountain bikers, and surfers. In such cases, the observer may fixate so intently on the target that they steer in the direction of their gaze, which is often the ultimate cause of a collision.

In other words, if you’re fixated on the end goal alone, you may not efficiently and effectively deal with the obstacles in your path.

If you’re so hell-bent on traveling in a straight line towards your goal, you may not realize you’re hiking up mountain to the very peak, just to go down the other side. When it would’ve been much easier and less dangerous to simply walk around it’s base.

Make sure the obstacle you’re trying to conquer is truly worthy of your time and effort. Some obstacles sit directly in your path with no way around them, others are an illusion that you can cleverly work around.

Also, make sure the *obstacles* are directly based off of the first **W**. Every necessary obstacle should be strung together and built upon the previous with as much correlation as possible.


## WOW
Next time you’re tasked with a new project, think about the WOW framework and how it can help you make the most efficient progress towards your goal.

- W—Where is the user, currently?
- O—What are the obstacles in their way?
- W—Where are you taking them to accomplish their goal? Why?

# xcrun: error: invalid active developer path ( /Library /Developer /Command Line Tools), missing xcrun

I upgraded to macOS Sierra, ran `git status` in the terminal and got the following error.

> xcrun: error: invalid active developer path ( /library /developer /command line tools), missing xcrun

No bueno.

A quick google search turned up [this post](http://tips.tutorialhorizon.com/2015/10/01/xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path-library-developer-commandline-tools-missing-xcrun/) with the answer I sought.

**Run this command to get git working again.**

`xcode-select --install`
