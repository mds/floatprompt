Fill in [NEED] placeholders with actual voice samples from your content across all contexts

### **Step 2: Validate Voice Violations**
Test NOT MDS vs. IS MDS pairs to ensure AI can distinguish authentic from inauthentic voice

### **Step 3: Refine Context Triggers**
Validate that context rules accurately capture when and how your voice naturally adapts

### **Step 4: Verify Non-Negotiable Rules**
Ensure rules capture truly unbreakable patterns vs. flexible preferences

### **Step 5: Complete Micro-Pattern Library**

## üîß Implementation Notes

**For AI Voice Application:**
- Voice DNA samples provide templates for authentic voice generation
- Violation examples prevent common voice drift patterns
- Context triggers enable appropriate voice adaptation
- Non-negotiable rules maintain core voice integrity
- Micro-patterns add authentic voice fingerprint details

**For Voice Guide Refinement:**
- Replace complex slider systems with practical voice samples
- Focus on immediately usable patterns over theoretical frameworks
- Enable rapid voice validation through violation/correction pairs
- Provide clear rules for maintaining voice authenticity across contexts

**This validation guide serves as the practical foundation for refining existing MDS voice guides with immediately usable voice intelligence.**
