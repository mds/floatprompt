‚ñ° Preserve quality scores and validation notes from individual extractions
‚ñ° Document any conflicts or overlaps discovered during reconstruction
‚ñ° Verify archaeological integrity before finalizing combined library
```

### **Quality Control Integration**
```
VALIDATION GATES FOR RECONSTRUCTION:
‚ñ° Pre-reconstruction audit: Check for duplicate content across source files
‚ñ° Context verification: Confirm samples match intended context boundaries
‚ñ° Quality validation: Verify all samples meet minimum authenticity standards
‚ñ° Integration testing: Confirm organized library maintains individual sample quality
‚ñ° Final validation: Archaeological preservation confirmed across complete library
```

### **Usage Optimization**
```
ACCESS OPTIMIZATION FEATURES:
‚ñ° Clear section navigation enabling rapid context selection
‚ñ° Quality scoring enabling appropriate sample selection for use case
‚ñ° Evidence tagging enabling pattern-specific sample identification
‚ñ° Usage notes providing application guidance for each sample
‚ñ° Cross-referencing enabling pattern recognition across contexts
```

**This reconstruction specification ensures that the combined voice DNA sample library maintains complete archaeological preservation while providing systematic organization and optimal AI access for authentic MDS voice application.**
