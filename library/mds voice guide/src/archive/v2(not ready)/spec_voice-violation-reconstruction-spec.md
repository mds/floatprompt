# üö´ MDS Voice Violation Prevention Library

**Complete Violation/Correction Pairs for Authentic Voice Drift Prevention**

> **40-50 violation/correction pairs extracted from authentic voice patterns with conflict resolution and context-appropriate application guidance**

*This library contains voice violation examples with authentic corrections organized by context, providing direct guidance for preventing voice drift and maintaining authentic MDS communication patterns.*

## üìä **Violation Library Overview**

### **Violation Distribution**
```
TOTAL VIOLATIONS: 40-50 violation/correction pairs
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE VIOLATIONS: 8-12 pairs (apply across all contexts)
PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION VIOLATIONS: 8-10 pairs (business context specific)
PERSONAL EXPRESSION VIOLATIONS: 8-10 pairs (personal context specific)
EDUCATIONAL INSTRUCTION VIOLATIONS: 8-10 pairs (teaching context specific)
CONTEXT-CROSSING VIOLATIONS: 6-8 pairs (patterns spanning multiple contexts)

CONFLICT RESOLUTION: Hierarchical resolution with DNA sample evidence validation
AUTHENTICITY VALIDATION: All corrections verified against DNA sample library
```

### **Usage Guidelines**
```
PRIMARY USE: Voice drift prevention and authentic correction application
CONTEXT SELECTION: Apply violations matching intended communication context
CONFLICT RESOLUTION: Follow hierarchical resolution when violations overlap
CORRECTION VALIDATION: Verify corrections against DNA sample evidence
PREVENTION PRIORITY: Universal violations take precedence over context-specific
```

### **Conflict Resolution Hierarchy**
```
RESOLUTION PRIORITY ORDER:
1. DNA sample evidence overrides theoretical corrections
2. Context-specific violations take precedence over generic violations  
3. Universal language violations apply across all contexts
4. More recent/authentic examples supersede older correction patterns
5. Archaeological preservation supersedes systematic consistency
6. Ambiguous cases require human validation and resolution
```

## üîß **Reconstruction Implementation Notes**

### **Archaeological Preservation Requirements**
```
MANDATORY PRESERVATION PROTOCOLS:
‚ñ° Copy all violation/correction examples verbatim from source extraction files
‚ñ° Maintain complete context information and applicability notes for each violation
‚ñ° Preserve conflict resolution documentation and decision rationale
‚ñ° Document DNA sample evidence supporting all correction examples
‚ñ° Verify archaeological integrity before finalizing combined violation library
```

### **Conflict Resolution Validation**
```
RESOLUTION QUALITY GATES:
‚ñ° Pre-reconstruction conflict audit: Identify all conflicts between source files
‚ñ° Hierarchical resolution: Apply resolution hierarchy consistently across all conflicts
‚ñ° DNA evidence validation: Verify all corrections against authentic DNA sample evidence
‚ñ° Context boundary verification: Confirm context specificity maintained during resolution
‚ñ° Final integration testing: Validate resolved library maintains authenticity and usability
```

### **Quality Control Integration**
```
VALIDATION GATES FOR RECONSTRUCTION:
‚ñ° Violation authenticity: Verify all "NOT MDS" examples represent actual voice drift risks
‚ñ° Correction validity: Confirm all "IS MDS" examples match authentic DNA sample patterns
‚ñ° Context appropriateness: Validate context boundaries and application guidance
‚ñ° Conflict resolution: Verify all conflicts resolved using hierarchical approach
‚ñ° Archaeological preservation: Confirm voice correction authenticity maintained throughout
```

**This reconstruction specification ensures that the combined voice violation prevention library resolves all conflicts through hierarchical resolution while maintaining complete archaeological preservation of authentic voice correction examples.**
