Daily session log. Newest entries first.

# Session 2 — 21:00 (Architecture Migration)

Migrating to `_float/` container folder architecture.

---

## 21:15 — Migrate to _float/ container architecture
commit: 7b8c891

- Created `_float/` folder in root with system.md, index.md, logs/
- Moved `_system.md` → `_float/system.md`
- Moved `_float.md` → `_float/index.md`
- Moved `sessions/log-*.md` → `_float/logs/*.md`
- Created `_float/` folders in all subfolders (docs, context, dev, experimental, artifacts, etc.)
- Moved all `_float.md` → `_float/index.md` in subfolders
- Deleted `sessions/` folder (absorbed into `_float/logs/`)
- Updated `_float/system.md` with new structure map and boot sequence
- Updated all references throughout

Architecture change: FloatSystem files now contained in `_float/` folders, eliminating collision risk for npm-installable tooling.

---

# Session 1 — 14:00 (FloatSystem Genesis)

Implementing FloatSystem architecture from specs. Continuous session.

---

## 20:00 — Refine _float/ architecture naming
commit: 9303572

- Underscore only on folder (`_float/`), not files inside
- Main file: `index.md` (familiar like index.html)
- Standard files: `system.md`, `index.md`, `logs/`, `config.md`
- Folder IS the namespace — no redundant prefixes

---

## 19:55 — Create _float/ folder architecture exploration
commit: 02fbeef

- Exploring `_float/` container folder for npm-installable FloatSystem
- Document: `artifacts/float-folder-architecture-exploration.md`
- For validation with separate AI agent before implementation

---

## 19:45 — Add implicit verification to boot sequence
commit: 26949b4

- Step 3 now includes: "Verify Contents tables match actual folder contents. Flag discrepancies."
- Structure IS the specification - format implies verification
- No verbose per-file hooks needed

---

## 19:35 — Fix stale reference
commit: cbb1e54

- artifacts/_float.md: `2025/float.md` → `2025/_float.md`
- Missed during underscore rename

---

## 19:30 — Convert to daily session logs
commit: 1eaf724

- Renamed log.md → log-2025-12-28.md
- Added session markers within daily logs
- Full documentation in sessions/_float.md
- One file per day, session headers when context resets

---

## 19:20 — Simplify _float-system.md → _system.md
commit: 842d31f

- Underscore already signals "system/meta file"
- No need for redundant "float" in filename
- Clean pair: `_system.md` + `_float.md`

---

## 2025-12-28 19:15 — Add underscore prefix to float files
commit: 105a849

- Renamed float-system.md → _float-system.md
- Renamed all float.md → _float.md (11 files)
- Files now sort to top of directory listings
- Underscore signals "system/meta file"
- Updated all references in specs and navigation

---

## 2025-12-28 19:00 — Rename system.md → float-system.md
commit: f01aa5a

- Renamed for filename readability (FloatSystem = proper name, float-system.md = file)
- Updated all references in specs and navigation files
- Kept historical log entries unchanged (archaeological preservation)
- Clear separation: float-system.md (behavior) vs float.md (navigation)

---

## 2025-12-28 18:30 — Add FloatDoc frontmatter to all docs
commit: 1c6085e

- Added full FloatDoc YAML frontmatter to all 13 documentation files
- Includes both human_ fields (author, intent, context) and ai_ fields (model, updated, notes)
- Updated FloatDoc spec: `float.md` naming, `related` field, multiple types
- Standardized on FloatNav naming across all 5 artifact specs
- Updated docs/float.md and docs/philosophy/float.md with Intent column

---

## 2025-12-28 18:00 — Add explicit penetration sequence
commit: d4a25e5

- Boot sequence now explicitly instructs AI to traverse ALL float.md files
- Added steps: read sessions/log.md, skim key docs, build mental model
- Updated structure map to include sessions/log.md and dev/updates/
- Goal: AI has full project context before taking any action
- Penetration order: system.md → float.md files → session log → key docs → ready

---

## 2025-12-28 17:30 — Add distributed AI hooks
commit: e70e06f

- Added context-specific AI hooks to all 12 float.md files
- Updated system.md: removed CLAUDE.md refs, added session log format, added "Distributed Hooks" section
- Fixed stale CLAUDE.md references in artifacts/float.md, artifacts/2025/float.md, docs/philosophy/float.md
- Pattern: centralized protocol in system.md, distributed triggers in each float.md

---

## 2025-12-28 17:15 — Convert to changelog format
commit: cf09648

- Created sessions/log.md (changelog-style, newest first)
- Removed per-day session files
- Each entry: timestamp, commit hash, brief bullets

---

## 2025-12-28 16:45 — Delete CLAUDE.md files
commit: e56e2aa

- Removed 6 CLAUDE.md files (629 lines total)
- float.md is now the single standard for folder context
- Works on any AI platform, not just Claude Code

---

## 2025-12-28 16:20 — Expand float.md files
commit: f0d581c

- Expanded root float.md with full repo context (~285 lines)
- Expanded docs/float.md with reading order, key concepts
- Expanded dev/float.md with folder structure, safety requirements
- Expanded experimental/float.md with full structure, components list
- float.md now contains everything CLAUDE.md had, plus more

---

## 2025-12-28 15:45 — Rename index.md to float.md
commit: 90ac19b

- Branding decision: float.md more visible than index.md
- Mirrors CLAUDE.md naming convention
- Updated all references in system.md and other files

---

## 2025-12-28 15:30 — Add float.md to all subfolders
commit: 101d6cb

- Created float.md for: docs/, docs/philosophy/, docs/reference/, context/, dev/, dev/updates/, experimental/, artifacts/, artifacts/2025/
- Complete navigation coverage across repository

---

## 2025-12-28 15:00 — Initial FloatSystem implementation
commit: 1dc6d17

- Created floatsystem branch
- Created system.md (boot loader with structure map)
- Created root float.md (navigation)
- Created sessions/ folder with float.md
- Implementing FloatSystem specs from artifacts/

---

## 2025-12-28 14:00 — Session start
commit: (none)

- Read all CLAUDE.md files across repo
- Read core documentation (fp.md, mds-method.md, goals.md, principles.md, voice.md)
- Read philosophy files (manifesto.md, orientation.md, discovery.md)
- Read FloatSystem specs in artifacts/
- Read genesis session handoff (floatsystem-session-2025-12-28.md)
- Built full context before implementation
