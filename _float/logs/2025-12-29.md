## 2025-12-29 — Boot, cleanup, and subfolder conventions

- Booted FloatPrompt System via `@float boot`
- Identified 3 integrity issues during boot
- Removed deprecated `docs/_float/` folder (orphaned from centralization)
- Fixed `nav/experimental.md` — removed nonexistent `tsconfig.json` reference
- Discussed subfolder naming conventions for nav files
- Added **Nav File Subfolder Rules** to `_float/system.md`:
  - List: navigable subfolders with distinct purposes
  - Skip: build outputs, archives, deprecated nested `_float/`
  - Split threshold: 10+ items or complex internal structure

System status: Clean. No remaining issues.

## 2025-12-29 — Context layer added (v0.7.0)

Added auto-generated context files to FloatPrompt System with organized subfolders.

**New structure:**
```
_float/
├── system.md
├── context/
│   └── project.md          # AI terrain map (auto-generated)
├── tools/
│   └── context-creator.md  # Tool for generating context
├── nav/
└── logs/
```

**New files:**
- `_float/context/project.md` — AI terrain map (auto-generated)
- `_float/tools/context-creator.md` — Floatprompt tool for generating context
- `artifacts/float-context-spec.md` — Specification for context layer

**Updated files:**
- `_float/system.md` — Boot sequence now includes context (step 3), structure map updated, version bumped to 0.7.0
- `.claude/commands/float.md` — Added Context Buoy to buoy types
- `_float/nav/artifacts.md` — Added new spec reference

**Concept:**
- nav/*.md = WHAT exists (structure, file lists)
- context/project.md = WHY it exists and HOW it connects (meaning, relationships, reading order)

**Design decisions:**
- `project.md` is default filename, but Context Buoy can choose better name if project suggests one (emergent naming)
- Future: domain-specific context files as siblings (e.g., `frontend.md`, `api.md`)
- No nav files for _float subfolders — system.md covers internal structure

Context Buoy spawns during `/float` if context missing, or during `/float sync` if significant changes detected.

System status: v0.7.0 operational.
