## 2025-12-29 — Boot, cleanup, and subfolder conventions

- Booted FloatPrompt System via `@float boot`
- Identified 3 integrity issues during boot
- Removed deprecated `docs/_float/` folder (orphaned from centralization)
- Fixed `nav/experimental.md` — removed nonexistent `tsconfig.json` reference
- Discussed subfolder naming conventions for nav files
- Added **Nav File Subfolder Rules** to `_float/system.md`:
  - List: navigable subfolders with distinct purposes
  - Skip: build outputs, archives, deprecated nested `_float/`
  - Split threshold: 10+ items or complex internal structure

System status: Clean. No remaining issues.
