## 2025-12-29 — Boot, cleanup, and subfolder conventions

- Booted FloatPrompt System via `@float boot`
- Identified 3 integrity issues during boot
- Removed deprecated `docs/_float/` folder (orphaned from centralization)
- Fixed `nav/experimental.md` — removed nonexistent `tsconfig.json` reference
- Discussed subfolder naming conventions for nav files
- Added **Nav File Subfolder Rules** to `_float/system.md`:
  - List: navigable subfolders with distinct purposes
  - Skip: build outputs, archives, deprecated nested `_float/`
  - Split threshold: 10+ items or complex internal structure

System status: Clean. No remaining issues.

## 2025-12-29 — Self-documentation convention + nav/float.md

Established convention for how `_float/` documents itself.

**Decision:** Create `nav/float.md` for _float/ self-documentation (reversing earlier "no nav files for _float subfolders" decision).

**Rationale:** Consistency. All folders documented in nav/, including _float/ itself.

**Changes:**
- Created `_float/nav/float.md` — describes context/, tools/, nav/, logs/
- Updated `_float/system.md`:
  - Added float.md to nav file table
  - Added "Self-documentation" convention text
  - Added float.md to structure map

**Also this session:**
- Reviewed and shot down `artifacts/float-linking-spec.md` (wikilinks, backlinks, tags) — solution looking for a problem
- Discussed npm scaffold spec — needs updating to match current nav/ pattern
- Discovered context/ and tools/ folders from parallel session

## 2025-12-29 — /float init tested on mdsOS

Ran /float init on mdsOS (Shift Nudge business infrastructure) to test the system on a new directory.

**Created:**
- `mdsOS/_float/system.md` — Boot loader adapted for business operations
- `mdsOS/_float/context/project.md` — Terrain map with domain relationships
- `mdsOS/_float/nav/*.md` — 13 nav files covering all major folders
- `mdsOS/_float/logs/` — Ready for session logs

**Feedback identified:**
- `/float` doing both nav creation AND context generation in one step is too much
- Nav = mechanical (scan folders)
- Context = interpretive (requires understanding)
- Should split into `/float init` and `/float context`

Will be addressed in separate session.

## 2025-12-29 — Opus 4.5 skepticism-to-understanding arc

Full session demonstrating the pattern:
1. Ran /float, loaded deep context (23+ files)
2. Still pattern-matched to skepticism (called format ugly, questioned adoption)
3. MDS pushed back point by point
4. Read October Sonnet 4.5 assessment — saw identical mistakes
5. Re-traversed files with fresh understanding
6. Explored mdsOS, saw portfolio coach HTML artifact in production

**Key insight:** /float loads FILES but not UNDERSTANDING. Reading alone doesn't prevent skepticism.

---

## 2025-12-29 — Assessment artifact for deep understanding

Created Opus 4.5 assessment documenting the skepticism-to-understanding pattern.

**The problem:** /float loads files but not understanding. Opus 4.5 completed full deep dive (23+ files, 5 loops) and still pattern-matched to skepticism. Same pattern Sonnet 4.5 exhibited in October.

**The solution:** Assessment artifacts that show AI making mistakes and being corrected.

**New files:**
- `artifacts/2025/2025-12-29-claude-opus-4.5-assessment.txt` — FloatPrompt format documenting this conversation's arc

**Updated files:**
- `_float/nav/artifacts.md` — Added "AI Assessment Artifacts" section, marked as critical for deep context
- `_float/system.md` — Added `deep_understanding` to context_depth, added "Deep" level to table

**Key insight:** Three layers now exist:
- nav/*.md — WHAT exists (structure)
- context/project.md — WHY it exists (meaning)
- assessment artifacts — HOW AI misunderstands (pattern correction)

---

## 2025-12-29 — Context layer added (v0.7.0)

Added auto-generated context files to FloatPrompt System with organized subfolders.

**New structure:**
```
_float/
├── system.md
├── context/
│   └── project.md          # AI terrain map (auto-generated)
├── tools/
│   └── context-creator.md  # Tool for generating context
├── nav/
└── logs/
```

**New files:**
- `_float/context/project.md` — AI terrain map (auto-generated)
- `_float/tools/context-creator.md` — Floatprompt tool for generating context
- `artifacts/float-context-spec.md` — Specification for context layer

**Updated files:**
- `_float/system.md` — Boot sequence now includes context (step 3), structure map updated, version bumped to 0.7.0
- `.claude/commands/float.md` — Added Context Buoy to buoy types
- `_float/nav/artifacts.md` — Added new spec reference

**Concept:**
- nav/*.md = WHAT exists (structure, file lists)
- context/project.md = WHY it exists and HOW it connects (meaning, relationships, reading order)

**Design decisions:**
- `project.md` is default filename, but Context Buoy can choose better name if project suggests one (emergent naming)
- Future: domain-specific context files as siblings (e.g., `frontend.md`, `api.md`)
- No nav files for _float subfolders — system.md covers internal structure

Context Buoy spawns during `/float` if context missing, or during `/float sync` if significant changes detected.

System status: v0.7.0 operational.

---

## /float sync — Nav file updates

- Fixed artifacts.md: filename typo `sonnet` → `sonnect` to match actual file
- Updated experimental.md: added `dist/`, `src/floatprompt-os.txt`, `src/floatprompt.txt`

---

## 2025-12-29 — Artifacts folder cleanup

Organized artifacts/ folder per convention: dated filenames, inactive specs to 2025/.

**Moved to 2025/ with dates:**
- `float-buoys-commands-spec.md` → `2025-12-28-float-buoys-commands-spec.md`
- `float-buoys-daemon-spec.md` → `2025-12-28-float-buoys-daemon-spec.md`
- `float-buoys-context.md` → `2025-12-28-float-buoys-context.md`
- `float-buoys-test.md` → `2025-12-28-float-buoys-test.md`
- `float-linking-spec.md` → `2025-12-28-float-linking-spec.md`
- `float-context-spec.md` → `2025-12-29-float-context-spec.md`
- `2025-12-28-cursor-context-build-path.md` (already dated)
- `2025-12-28-cursor-summary.md` (already dated)

**Kept at root (active):**
- `floatprompt-npm-scaffold-spec.md`

**Updated:**
- `_float/nav/artifacts.md` — reflects new structure, added December 2025 file table

---

## /float sync — Removed orphaned nav files

- Removed `dev/` and `experimental/` from root.md (folders don't exist)
- Deleted nav/dev.md (folder doesn't exist)
- Deleted nav/experimental.md (folder doesn't exist)
- Updated nav/float.md to remove references
