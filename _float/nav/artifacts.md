# Artifacts

Historical archive of specifications, session handoffs, and explorations.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **floatprompt-npm-scaffold-spec.md** | Current npm tool specification |
| **float-buoys-commands-spec.md** | On-demand /float and /float sync commands |
| **float-buoys-daemon-spec.md** | Background daemon to auto-maintain floatsystem files |
| **float-buoys-context.md** | Strategic thinking behind Float Buoys specification |
| **float-buoys-test.md** | Step-by-step validation of /float commands |
| **float-linking-spec.md** | Wikilinks, tags, and backlinks for the floatsystem |
| **float-context-spec.md** | Auto-generated context file for AI terrain mapping |
| **2025-12-28-cursor-context-build-path.md** | AI agent's 24-file read sequence for context |

## Subfolders

### 2025/

Historical archive containing 150+ files documenting the evolution of FloatPrompt.

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Specifications** | floatprompt-spec.md, floatnav-spec.md, floatdoc-spec.md |
| **Session Handoffs** | floatsystem-session-*.md |
| **Explorations** | Various exploration documents |
| **Assessments** | AI understanding evolution documents (critical for onboarding) |

#### AI Assessment Artifacts (Critical for Deep Context)

These floatprompts document the skepticism-to-understanding pattern that AI consistently exhibits when encountering FloatPrompt. **Read these during deep context loading** — they prevent the pattern-matching mistakes that occur even after reading 23+ files.

| File | Model | Key Insight |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **2025-10-30-claude-sonnect-4.5-assessment.txt** | Sonnet 4.5 | First documented skepticism arc, evidence hierarchy |
| **2025-12-29-claude-opus-4.5-assessment.txt** | Opus 4.5 | Confirms pattern persists despite full deep dive |

Why these matter:
- AI pattern-matches to skepticism regardless of context volume
- Reading philosophy and examples doesn't prevent dismissal
- Seeing another AI make identical mistakes breaks the pattern
- Assessments are the missing layer between structure and understanding

## Archaeological Note

Files in `2025/` represent the thinking and iteration that led to current FloatPrompt. They have historical value but may not reflect current specifications.

**Current specs live in `docs/`**. Artifacts are for understanding how we got here.

## When to Reference

- Understanding design decisions
- Seeing evolution of concepts
- Finding original rationale for features
- Session handoff context
