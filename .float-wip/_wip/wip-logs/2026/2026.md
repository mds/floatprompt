# 2026 Decisions

Context-compiler development year.

---

## Themes

- **AI orchestrates** — AI delegates to TS/CLI/buoys, does cognitive work
- **Token economy** — Minimum tokens, maximum accuracy
- **Archival structure** — Collection/Series/File/Item hierarchy
- **Archive unity** — ONE archive with Series, "logs" as umbrella term
- **Nav structure** — Mirror project, `_/` convention, map/context/logs
- **Vercel infrastructure** — AI SDK + Sandbox for cloud agents
- **Storage architecture** — SQLite replaces flat files (4-phase evolution)
