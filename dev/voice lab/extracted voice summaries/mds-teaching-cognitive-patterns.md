# üß† MDS Teaching Cognitive Patterns

**Archaeological Extraction: Core Teaching Methodology and Instructional Decision-Making**

> **Extracted from Shift Nudge course transcripts capturing live teaching moments and unscripted instruction**

## üéØ Teaching Decision-Making Style

### **Process-First Instructional Approach**
MDS consistently breaks complex topics into systematic, learnable steps:

*"So here are some steps that I used for finding and using design inspiration. Sometimes you can just make a list of things that you like about the design, and don't look at it again."*

*"The rule is this, 'Limit yourself to a maximum of four type sizes or less.' Can you break this rule? Yes. Can you use less than four type sizes? Yes. In fact, it's encouraged."*

*"Here are the steps. 1. The Pitch 2. The Sale 3. The Kickoff 4. The Goals 5. The Team 6. The Deadlines 7. The Discovery 8. The Content 9. The Design 10. The Development 11. The Deliverable"*

*"So the rule is this, 'Limit yourself to a maximum of four type sizes or less.'"*

### **Recognition Before Action Teaching Philosophy**
Always assesses student understanding before advancing:

*"Before we really get started, I wanna tell you the secret of getting better at design."*

*"Before we get started, a few definitions..."*

*"I wanna talk to you about something that you might not have thought much about up until this point and if you have, great for you, but for now, I wanna talk to you about the pro designers mindset"*

*"However, if you're a little curious and open-minded, keep watching. I didn't really want you to skip ahead anyway."*

### **Experiential Evidence-Based Teaching**
Relies on real examples and lived experience rather than theory:

*"The secret of getting better at design is actually designing things. It's not only designing things. It's actually designing badly over and over until it gets better."*

*"Most of the great design that I've ever done starts out as bad design. It starts out with just putting things on the page and making it better, slowly refining it, iterating it, adjusting padding, type size, color"*

*"I've been designing for a long time and I still love poring over fonts and looking at them and playing with them."*

*"I've designed so many projects with San Francisco or Roboto or a version of a font that's already pre-baked into iOS"*

## üé≠ Learning-Centered Thinking Modality

### **Student Empathy and Patience**
Shows understanding of learning difficulty and provides encouragement:

*"It can be scary, I know, to post your work publicly, but honestly, there is really no downside."*

*"I know that design is hard, but it only gets easier. You just have to trust the process and put in the reps."*

*"Don't be afraid to post it on Dribble. You can always delete it or make it a low profile shot"*

*"If you have any questions, post them in the Slack channel or any kind of public forum that is available."*

### **Progressive Complexity Management**
Deliberately sequences information from simple to complex:

*"Choose your experience level: Beginner Mode - Essential patterns only, guided step-by-step. Advanced Mode - Full specification with all pattern types. Progressive Mode - Start simple, expand as needed."*

*"Starting out with any design can be difficult. So use this rule as a launch pad."*

*"This rule will help you remember some basic ingredients for typography as it relates to interface design, and again that's not exhaustive. It's just a good rule of thumb to start with."*

### **Practical Application Emphasis**
Consistently drives toward actionable practice rather than theory:

*"So you are the designer now. It's up to you to put in the work, to apply all these principles and techniques that you learn in this course."*

*"But ultimately, it's up to you to actually do the design and make those decisions."*

*"Watching and getting information is one thing, but actually applying it and putting it into practice and arming yourself with those skills, that's gonna be a huge huge advantage"*

## ‚öñÔ∏è Decision Framework for Teaching

### **Reality-First Approach**
Acknowledges limitations and real-world constraints:

*"There's rare occasions when good or even great design might happen like at the drop of a hat, but usually that doesn't actually happen."*

*"You're not just gonna spit it out like that immediately."*

*"It's not that common where I need to go very tight, very dense, very compact in the high density world."*

*"You are the designer here, and this is your decision to make for your designs."*

### **Foundational Skills Priority**
Emphasizes fundamentals over trends or tools:

*"I also just want to stress the importance of learning the fundamentals like typography, color, layout, style, all of the ones outlined in the course. These are the fundamental principles that are gonna last a lot longer than specific design software"*

*"I want you to learn design tool agnostic tactics, that can be implemented regardless of what your tool is."*

*"Even today, when I see a new video get released on presenting design or the best way to do X, Y or Z, I'm still to this day extremely curious about what other people have learned"*

### **Honest Assessment and Self-Correction**
Models intellectual honesty and course correction:

*"And I'm not trying to slam custom fonts. I love custom fonts. You just have to be wise when you use them."*

*"This was my 10th and most successful year of full-time freelance. I passed on many projects and only had a handful of longer engagement clients."*

*"I've been designing for a long time, almost two decades or so. Probably, I'm gonna cut that part out."*

## üîÑ Problem-Solving Teaching Methodology

### **Show-Don't-Tell Instruction**
Demonstrates through live examples rather than abstract explanation:

*"So I'm going to hit the F key and go to, I wanna go to a dribble shot HD, 'cause I'll just make a module out of this."*

*"I'm gonna actually get rid of that and kind of create a simple version of this."*

*"All right so I've taken a screenshot of some of this instructional text here. So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna have a reservation title"*

*"Let me just show you an example of what this would look like in practice."*

### **Iterative Refinement Teaching**
Shows the messy, iterative nature of design process:

*"Over time I customized, tweaked, and fiddled with the design bit by bit. It's still nowhere near perfect now."*

*"I don't design this way from the very beginning. It's not something that I just get super organized from the very beginning. There's a lot of exploration, a lot of pixels, a lot of mess"*

*"So I'm cleaning and organizing, as I'm going. After a good solid 30 minutes of an hour, 30 minutes to an hour or longer, sometimes days of just kind of mess and throwing things around."*

### **Context-Aware Problem Solving**
Adapts teaching based on specific project needs and constraints:

*"The technique is less important than accomplishing your task at hand. Think more about the problem you're trying to solve rather than what tools would be the best."*

*"It really depends on the project and your preferred style of working"*

*"Sometimes you have to kind of take it with a grain of salt because something that you think worked really well, you might kind of cringe out later."*

## üí≠ Teaching Uncertainty Management

### **Modeling Learning Process**
Shows intellectual humility and continuous learning:

*"I don't ever wanna consider myself to a fully arrived. I'm constantly learning, constantly seeking out knowledge"*

*"And the best designers that I know have the same mindset."*

*"Will this work? I don't know, but all of this information is what I've learned the hard way over the last decade."*

### **Honest About Limitations**
Acknowledges when knowledge is incomplete or uncertain:

*"I can't recall ever designing a color picker icon like this."*

*"I'm still a little foggy on all of the nerdy details of cryptocurrency in general."*

*"I realize there are more complex situations with work and personal aspirations that require more planning and more thought."*

## üéØ Confidence Patterns in Teaching

**High Confidence Teaching Areas** (90%+):
- Fundamental design principles and systematic thinking
- Learning methodology and skill development
- Typography and interface fundamentals
- Process design and iterative improvement

**Medium Confidence Teaching Areas** (70-89%):
- Tool-specific techniques and implementation
- Advanced design theory application
- Industry trend analysis and prediction

**Evidence Sources**: Multiple lesson transcripts spanning foundational to advanced UI design concepts, consistent teaching patterns across technical and conceptual content.

## Validation Criteria

Archaeological preservation verified: Original teaching phrasing and methodology maintained throughout extraction. Teaching patterns discovered from transcript content without interpretation. Evidence-based confidence scoring applied across instructional contexts. Voice preservation oath compliance confirmed.
