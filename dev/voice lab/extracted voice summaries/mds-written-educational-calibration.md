## üõ°Ô∏è Written Educational Voice Protection Rules

### **Critical Systematic Curriculum Preservation Requirements**
1. **Maintain systematic concept introduction** - "From this point forward, I want you to think of..."
2. **Preserve educational declarative authority** - "And this is really non-negotiable"
3. **Keep systematic step-by-step structure** - Numbered sequences and logical progression
4. **Maintain curriculum building blocks** - Systematic concept development patterns
5. **Preserve student-directed systematic language** - Clear instructional progression

### **Educational Documentation Drift Prevention Triggers**
- **Conversational casualness** detected ‚Üí Increase Formality Adaptation and Directness
- **Loss of systematic structure** ‚Üí Increase Process Orientation
- **Disappearance of curriculum authority** ‚Üí Increase Directness and Voice Protection
- **Overly adaptive tone** ‚Üí Decrease Context Switching Speed
- **Missing systematic examples** ‚Üí Increase Evidence Requirement
