# 📝 MDS Teaching Language Profile

**Archaeological Extraction: Spoken Sentence Structure, Vocabulary, and Instructional Rhythm**

> **Extracted from Shift Nudge course transcripts analyzing 200+ spoken language samples across live instruction**

## 🔤 Spoken Sentence Structure Patterns

### **Conversational Teaching Directness**
Natural spoken clarity with warm authority:

*"All right, you've made it. Welcome to the course."*

*"So before we really get started, I wanna tell you the secret of getting better at design."*

*"And the secret is not really a secret."*

*"Here's the deal."*

*"So let's take a look."*

*"All right, great."*

*"So that's what I'm going to do."*

*"Okay, great."*

### **Teaching-Specific Compound Construction**
Extended explanatory sentences with natural spoken rhythm:

*"At any point along your journey, I want you to feel free to reach out directly to me. I am here to support you. I am here to support your success, and your success at becoming a better designer is my number one priority"*

*"Most of the great design that I've ever done starts out as bad design. It starts out with just putting things on the page and making it better, slowly refining it, iterating it, adjusting padding, type size, color"*

*"That way other people in the course can read the answers, can see the questions, and we can all just kind of learn together as everyone's asking questions and getting answers."*

### **Spoken Transitional Bridging**
Natural spoken connectors between ideas:

*"So, let's talk about how everything works."*

*"Now, I wanna highly encourage you to join the Slack group"*

*"That's your decision to make for your designs."*

### **Accessible Technical Explanation**
Simplifies complex concepts through spoken analogy:

*"It's like Über for shipping."*

*"Adobe Illustrator, which I very creatively called AIUX."*

*"This is gonna be where I always put exported design files."*

*"So we're monitoring thermal images here, we're looking for heat signatures"*

*"So this was a simple little app and I didn't do any wireframing whatsoever."*

### **Process-Oriented Instruction**
Clear step-by-step spoken delivery:

*"So here are some steps that I used for finding and using design inspiration."*

*"So some of the design tool deciding factors, number one is gonna be the team."*

*"So for homework, I want you to choose a design software, if you haven't already."*

## 🎵 Spoken Rhythm and Flow Patterns
