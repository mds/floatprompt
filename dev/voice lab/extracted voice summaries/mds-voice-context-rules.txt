# üé≠ MDS Context Rules

**Archaeological Extraction: Voice Adaptation Across Writing Contexts**

> **Extracted from 10+ years of content analyzing voice modulation across personal, professional, educational, and business contexts**

## üìö Educational/Tutorial Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Patient teacher, step-by-step guidance, encouraging tone

**Opening Patterns**:
*"Welcome to the first official post in the AIUX series."*
*"In this video, we're going to create a simple iPhone wireframe that can be used as a base for iPhone apps and mobile web design wireframes."*
*"Continuing on with AIUX series, we're going to look at creating an iPad wireframe..."*

**Instructional Language**:
*"Watch the video below for further explanation."*
*"You can see in the image above that..."*
*"Let's dig into what it takes to handle the pixels and the people really well."*
*"Now that your rectangle is centered, hover just above the top right anchor point until the cursor changes to a quarter-circle icon."*

**Encouragement and Accessibility**:
*"Yes you could probably find a download of this on Dribbble or somewhere else, but wouldn't you like to be able to knock out one of these bad boys all by youself?"*
*"If you want to know how to create these for devices for yourself, check out these tutorials."*
*"Go forth and blog!"*
*"Now, go wireframe all the things!"*

**Technical Clarity**:
*"Before we get started, a few definitions..."*
*"Here's a quick breakdown of the time it took to build and ship the product."*
*"Some of the main tools used here are: Select Tool V, Direct Select A, Pen Tool P, Modifier Keys - cmd and opt"*

## üíº Business/Professional Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Confident consultant, systems-focused, value-driven

**Authority Statements**:
*"I've been independently designing for clients all over the world for the last decade and have lots to tell you."*
*"The latter half of the past decade at Studio Mds has accounted for a large amount of mobile design work."*
*"I'm confident we could hit the deadlines oulined in the 12Stone RFP with any of the above packages."*

**Value Proposition Language**:
*"These packages are designed to give 12Stone the biggest bang for the buck at various budget levels."*
*"I wouldn't normally just randomly throw out numbers like this, but I want to start showing how beneficial this type of UX design work can be, especially when you sell the value of your work, rather than only hours."*

**Process Documentation**:
*"If anything seems unclear or you have any questions please feel free to reach out by phone or email immediately."*
*"Here are the deliverables to be provided so everyone knew what to expect from me."*
*"Set deadlines for everything, not just the pie in the sky launch date."*

**Professional Relationships**:
*"I've enjoyed working with each of these people on both small and large projects. I'm confident each one would give a great testimony of our history together."*
*"Thanks for taking the time to read through this. Please reach out if you have any questions!"*

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Personal/Family Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Vulnerable, reflective, warm, deeply personal

**Family Priority Statements**:
*"My wife and kids are the most important thing in my life. I will not prioritize anything above them, long term."*
*"Having four kids is hard. The other day my wife was holding our new baby while our 2 middle kids were melting down at the dinner table and screaming."*
*"I have no idea who I would be if it weren't for my wife and kids. Most likely I would be a complete wreck with very poor nutrition and hygiene."*

**Vulnerability and Growth**:
*"I reflect often on the way I choose to spend my time, the projects I choose to work on, and how I live my life."*
*"There are plenty of times when I legitimately don't have time for a 2 hour bike ride without neglecting my wife and four kids."*
*"Days like today amplify those thoughts. Life is not to be taken for granted."*

**Life Philosophy**:
*"I want my daughter to know that she desperately needs my love and attention. Give it to her."*
*"Here's to a curious 2014."*
*"The soul attracts that which it secretly harbours; that which it loves, and also that which it fears."*

**Narrative Storytelling**:
*"That young teenager staring at the stars and pondering life blinked once... now he's a married man and a father of four."*
*"My beautiful daughter Isa turned 1 on December 1, 2012. She has truly stolen my heart!"*

## üè≠ Industry/Professional Commentary Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Analytical observer, constructive critic, solution-oriented

**Industry Analysis**:
*"There's been a lot of random drama on 'design twitter' as people call it. Mainly because... Well let's face it, designers have a lot of opinions."*
*"I don't know about you, but to me it seems like the general population in the tech industry is kind of, sort of obsessed with murder."*

**Constructive Challenge**:
*"Let's not kill the hamburger icon just yet. Why don't we, I don't know, talk to it for a while - see if he'll give us any information."*
*"Challenge ideas? Yes. Kill them quickly? No."*
*"We need the hamburger icon, or at least something like it. We can use a hotdog for all I care, but please - let's let the idea live and breathe."*

**Solution-Oriented Approach**:
*"If we completely abandon patterns like the hamburger menu icon, we will limit the progression of our interfaces by polluting our thinking."*
*"Remember that design is about putting focus on certain things and hiding others."*

## üìù Reflective/Year Review Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Honest assessor, grateful perspective, forward-looking

**Assessment Language**:
*"2013 marked my 5th year in business for myself. The year was great as I did incrementally increase revenue but also worked a lot less."*
*"This was my 10th and most successful year of full-time freelance."*
*"Another year is in the books so let's recap."*

**Gratitude Expression**:
*"I've been blessed beyond all measure and thank God so much for allowing me to have such a full life."*
*"I'm really amazed at how far we've come with our relationship, communication skills, and overall emotional heath and maturity."*

**Goal Setting**:
*"Hopefully I can post some more mobile case studies soon!"*
*"Some other random goals: Redesign this site by the end of Q1, Write for a minimum of 30 minutes daily..."*

**Honest Evaluation**:
*"Most years I create some well rounded list of goals like I did last year. Some of them are met and most are not."*
*"I used the extreme time constraint of so much client work as an unmovable excuse for my lack of follow through on my own AIUX project."*

## üöÄ Product Launch/Marketing Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Excited advocate, benefit-focused, authentic enthusiasm

**Launch Excitement**:
*"I'm simply and utterly blown away by the response after launching introtoicons.com last week."*
*"Speaking of fun, you should totally go snag this app!"*
*"Still reading this? Go get the app!"*

**Benefit Communication**:
*"This approach ensures we capture the full archaeological weight of Matt's voice without losing any nuanced patterns in a single massive extraction."*
*"If you're making interfaces in any form or fashion this app was built for you. Designer? Developer? QA person? Yes you."*

**Community Building**:
*"It would mean the world to me if you could share this on twitter."*
*"Hop on the list below where I share as much value as I can on a weekly basis."*

## üéØ Context Adaptation Rules

### **Audience Awareness Patterns**

**For Beginners**: More explanation, encouragement, step-by-step guidance
*"Yes you could probably find a download of this on Dribbble or somewhere else, but wouldn't you like to be able to knock out one of these bad boys all by youself?"*

**For Peers**: Shared experience, professional insights, technical depth
*"The most successful projects I've ever been a part of were when I worked hand-in-hand with the developer throughout the entire process."*

**For Family/Personal**: Vulnerability, emotion, life lessons
*"Do you have a daughter? She desperately needs your love and attention. Give it to her."*

### **Purpose-Driven Voice Modulation**

**Teaching**: Patient, encouraging, clear structure
**Selling**: Value-focused, benefit-driven, confident
**Reflecting**: Honest, grateful, thoughtful
**Analyzing**: Balanced, solution-oriented, constructive

### **Consistent Core Elements Across All Contexts**
