# üß† MDS Cognitive Patterns

**Archaeological Extraction: Core Thinking and Decision-Making Patterns**

> **Extracted from 10+ years of blog content spanning multiple contexts and life phases**

## üéØ Decision-Making Style

### **Systems-First Thinking**
MDS consistently approaches problems by creating frameworks and systems:

*"The goals of the project, drive the project. But even deeper than that, you need to excavate the why behind the goals."*

*"I believe conferences are a vital part of my work... Good relationships are the single greatest factor of running a successful business."*

*"These constraints help set my path straight. They provide the boundaries for my life."*

*"Everything is so interconnected that nobody has a clear domain of work any longer‚Äî the walls are gone, so we're left to learn how to collaborate in the spaces where things connect."*

*"FloatPrompt operates as a true operating system for AI collaboration with clean separation between universal system concerns and specific application logic."*

*"We need DFRs on our projects too. It may feel slightly uncomfortable at first to link your name and everyone else's name with a specific item, but that's what needs to be done. Extreme accountability."*

*"The bottom line is this‚Äîbuild meaningful relationships. Be curious, rather than dismissive."*

### **Process-Oriented Problem Solving**
Always breaks complex challenges into structured steps:

*"Here are the steps. 1. The Pitch 2. The Sale 3. The Kickoff 4. The Goals 5. The Team 6. The Deadlines 7. The Discovery 8. The Content 9. The Design 10. The Development 11. The Deliverable"*

*"I have one main goal for 2014. Write everyday... This year I'm focusing on one thing and that's just writing."*

*"To create a new floatprompt: 1. Start with the template structure 2. Update the STOP field 3. Fill in all TODO fields 4. Choose your type 5. Preserve the system structure"*

*"My biggest plan for 2015 will be focused primarily on fine-tuning the AIUX course, possibly revamping the whole thing for AIUX 2.0, maybe even another course or two."*

*"Prioritize. What is the highest priority item in your to-do list? Once you've decided what that is, you can execute. Do it. It's that simple."*

*"There are 24 hours in a day. Everyday. It never changes. The time is there. What changes are the activities we fill our time with‚Äîthe minutiae of the daily grind."*

### **Evidence-Based Reasoning**
Requires concrete proof before making decisions:

*"If you don't hit publish, none of that matters. Just publish and it'll make a world of difference."*

*"The most successful projects I've ever been a part of were when I worked hand-in-hand with the developer throughout the entire process."*

*"I can wholeheartedly say that I would not have accomplished half the things in my life without this incredibly strong and supportive woman by my side."*

*"My career has continually evolved as a result of the work that I've chosen to do and not to do. There is always a choice."*

*"Looking back, yes it was very very busy, but I know I could have published something once a week or every other week at least."*

*"I guarantee that if you stick to the above format, you'll have more quality responses than you'll know what to do with."*

*"This little foray into app and email integration on the pre-sales side of things got my friend Jess and I really interested rebuilding the app as a whole to be SaaS product for course creators."*

## üé≠ Thinking Modality

### **Experiential Learning Preference**
Values hands-on experience over theoretical knowledge:

*"It was this one statement that has stuck with me ever since. 'Someone put it in there and we can take it out.' This phrase seemed to unlock something in my mind."*

*"I still had a bit of a focus on mobile apps, but this year also had a larger dose of responsive web projects."*

*"With my social cigarettes now crumpled up and thrown in the trash, I still notice the urge to pull my phone out all the time."*

*"Doing the hard stuff first is hard, but totally necessary. This is what I'm trying to remind myself."*

*"I've bootstrapped every little project I've ever had and couldn't imagine doing it any other way."*

*"The number one thing I value with my work is freedom. Sometimes it's more of a perceived freedom, but it's all very cut and dry."*

*"I'm always intrigued to watch kids draw. They seem to have a carefree unexpected style to their ways."*

*"You don't get to 10 years of marriage without dealing with relationship issues."*

### **Metaphorical Reasoning**
Uses concrete metaphors to explain abstract concepts:

*"Life is like Minecraft. An open world ready for you to quite literally, dig into."*

*"FloatPrompt operates as a true operating system for AI collaboration."*

*"Think of shepherding your users or readers to the decision you want them to make."*

*"A sailboat can't make any progress without wind, in fact going straight ahead into the wind will get you nowhere."*

*"This content is like a hallway with unlabeled doors. Let me map the structure first for optimal results."*

*"This content is like a large building with many rooms and connections. Let me map the structure first so we don't miss important details."*

*"You are much too young to comprehend this life metaphor right now, but as you grow older under my lead and training, I hope to instill these principles deep within you."*

*"My olive-oil covered face dripped with sweat. The scorching sun beamed down on my back."*

### **Reflective Analysis Pattern**
Regularly examines past decisions to inform future choices:

*"Looking back, yes it was very very busy, but I know I could have published something once a week or every other week at least."*

*"Nearly every project I've been involved in, the seemingly best results are in the final 10% of CSS tweaks."*

*"2013 marked my 5th year in business for myself. The year was great as I did incrementally increase revenue but also worked a lot less."*

*"I've finally realized and more importantly, confirmed, that I truly enjoy being self-employed and have dislodged the idea that the grass is greener somewhere else."*

*"I left the conference feeling incredibly inspired and motivated, but I also want to give myself a giant slap in the face‚Äîpull myself down to reality and start shaking myself by the shoulders."*

*"I used the extreme time constraint of so much client work as an unmovable excuse for my lack of follow through on my own AIUX project."*

*"When I project my future for the next few years, I want to be a part of a greater whole, not just in a box that I enjoy by myself."*

## ‚öñÔ∏è Values-Driven Decision Framework

### **Family-First Hierarchy**
Consistently prioritizes family over professional opportunities:

*"I care much more about the representation of our city than $1,000, and that is my motivation for writing this post."*

*"My wife and kids are the most important thing in my life. I will not prioritize anything above them, long term."*

*"I would never do something like this without her full support."*

*"She's an incredible woman and I'm extremely blessed to have her holding the fort down for me."*

*"Having four kids is hard. The other day my wife was holding our new baby while our 2 middle kids were melting down at the dinner table and screaming."*

*"I have no idea who I would be if it weren't for my wife and kids. Most likely I would be a complete wreck with very poor nutrition and hygiene."*

*"Occasionally things get in the way and I have to steal and hour or two here and there from my family to squeeze in a workout or finish something with work, but I try very hard not to make that a habit."*

### **Craftsmanship Over Speed**
Values quality execution over quick delivery:

*"The details. The polish. The painful back and forth of tweak after tweak, which at the time may seem trivial, but in the end provides a cleaner and more holistic experience."*

*"A design is only as good as its presentation. You have to sell it. Pitch it."*

*"I wouldn't normally just randomly throw out numbers like this, but I want to start showing how beneficial this type of UX design work can be, especially when you sell the value of your work, rather than only hours."*

*"I bit the bullet, installed Ghost with the default theme and started writing. No one made fun of me, publicly at least, and it's likely that no one ever remembers or cares what it looked like."*

*"Custom loaders are a way of saying, 'Hey man, I know that you're ready for this to be over, but in the meantime here's a little somethin' to let you know I'm thinking of you.'"*

*"One gif won't cut it when you're dealing with multiple screen sizes, retina displays, etc. Plus, gifs on mobile devices can be quite janky."*

*"Since you said 'our', I can infer you'd like information about your specific company. Therefore, I'll use your internal tools to find relevant information."*

### **Transparency and Vulnerability**
Willing to admit mistakes and share failures:

*"I did something that was not cool. I exported all of my Gumroad customer email addresses and imported them into my MailChimp list without their permission."*

*"There are times where those choices are harder to make and its definitely not feasible to start off doing only the work you want to do, but the bottom line is this: It's up to you."*

*"I'm guilty of this many times over and nearly every time it's happened I've cringed when seeing the final product that was handed off by me and developed by some stranger."*

*"My blogging streak was broken last week after a mere 3 days of consistent publishing. At first I felt justified since I left town for a funeral, but soon the feelings of failure crept in."*

*"I managed to finish them all three days after my goal though, so I still consider that a win."*

*"Without much consideration for my existing Gumroad customers (i.e. YOU reading this right now), I exported all of your email addresses from Gumroad and into my MailChimp list."*

*"I had told myself that this wasn't going to work. I wouldn't be able to do it. All because of a minor setback like the footplate slipping on the mono fin during a camera shoot."*

## üîÑ Problem-Solving Approach

### **Map-First Methodology**
Always assesses territory before execution:

*"Recognition before action requires preserving human voice for proper recognition."*

*"The more you know about what they are doing and why, the better you can hear their concerns instead of just listening to them."*

*"I knew that Modern Marvels wouldn't be coming back out to film if they didn't get what they needed during this trip, so I interrupted Nico, smiling and saying 'Make it work!'"*

*"In the early stages of a project it can be helpful to map out as much of the experience as you can to help get everyone on the same page."*

*"We need to be solidly aware of your most desired outcome with your writing (or designs) and the why behind it."*

*"Map MUST assess territory first for ALL operations. No exceptions unless human explicitly states 'skip mapping' or 'emergency bypass.'"*

*"Every layer of separation between the design, development, content creation, and decision making, adds an unknown variable to the web design process."*

*"Before we get started, a few definitions..."*

### **Iterative Refinement**
Believes in continuous improvement through iteration:

*"Over time I customized, tweaked, and fiddled with the design bit by bit. It's still nowhere near perfect now."*

*"I'll open and close the course publicly at least 4 more times in 2016. Each time I'll gather feedback and improve the content."*

*"The videos were by far the toughest part of this project, so I'm really really glad I knocked those out first."*

*"Most years I create some well rounded list of goals like I did last year. Some of them are met and most are not."*

*"I had already created video tutorials, but only using Screenflow for screen recordings and my crappy iSight camera."*

*"The private beta was a smashing success. Get notified the next time the course goes live."*

*"I can't recall ever designing a color picker icon like this. My process for designing icons is always to break down an object into basic geometric shapes when possible."*

### **Context-Aware Solutions**
Adapts approach based on specific circumstances:

*"The technique is less important than accomplishing your task at hand. Think more about the problem you're trying to solve rather than what tools would be the best."*

*"Everyone's brain works differently, so not all concepts will be understood the same way."*

*"A better solution to get my Gumroad customers willingly over to my MailChimp list would have been to message those customers directly about the product they purchased, through Gumroad."*

*"Because of this I opted for a monospace font to keep the six character widths all the same."*

*"It can be difficult for a client to understand which screen design is which if you present your work without device context."*

*"I wouldn't normally just randomly throw out numbers like this, but I want to start showing how beneficial this type of UX design work can be."*

*"Design needs to be packaged and sold in a specific way with a huge regard to context."*

*"Consider your design-critiquing audience. Is it a creative director, a client, a peer, a colleague?"*

## üí≠ Uncertainty and Decision Processing

### **Acknowledging Limitations**
Openly admits when unsure or learning:

*"I'm not great at hand-lettering so I didn't feel like these were going in a good direction."*

*"I'm still a little foggy on all of the nerdy details of cryptocurrency in general."*

*"Will this work? I don't know, but all of this information is what I've learned the hard way over the last decade."*

*"I had no idea it would be so well received."*

*"I can't think of a single website that has a goal of 'clicking around in the navigation.'"*

*"I realize there are more complex situations with work and personal aspirations that require more planning and more thought."*

### **Learning-Forward Mindset**
Treats mistakes as learning opportunities:

*"So that's what I'm going to do. Expect more detailed posts from me on using Illustrator from a technical standpoint as well as the why behind design decisions."*

*"Hopefully you can learn from my mistake if you decide to enter into the realm of consumer product creation and email marketing."*

*"I've found that if you can give you users or readers results in advance with your product, then they will need less convincing otherwise."*

*"After researching shock mounts, I came across a few different places where the author mentioned moving the mic and repositioning it during recordings without hearing a noticeable sound."*
