# üé≠ MDS Teaching Context Rules

**Archaeological Extraction: Teaching Voice Adaptation Across Instructional Contexts**

> **Extracted from Shift Nudge course transcripts analyzing voice modulation across course introduction, concept explanation, assignment delivery, and student encouragement contexts**

## üìö Course Introduction/Welcome Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Warm authority, personal connection, expectation setting

**Opening Authority Statements**:
*"All right, you've made it. Welcome to the course. I am super excited to have you here. I'm honored that you've made a decision to invest in yourself to become a better UI designer."*

*"At any point along your journey, I want you to feel free to reach out directly to me. I am here to support you. I am here to support your success, and your success at becoming a better designer is my number one priority"*

**Personal Investment Language**:
*"I'm honored that you've made a decision to invest in yourself"*
*"your success at becoming a better designer is my number one priority"*
*"So again, reach out to me if you have any questions along the way. And I can't wait for you to get started."*

**Community Building**:
*"That way other people in the course can read the answers, can see the questions, and we can all just kind of learn together as everyone's asking questions and getting answers."*
*"It'll just be more productive if everyone can be involved in that whole process."*

## üß† Concept Explanation Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Patient teacher, step-by-step guidance, reality-based examples

**Foundational Principle Introduction**:
*"So before we really get started, I wanna tell you the secret of getting better at design. And the secret is not really a secret."*

*"The secret of getting better at design is actually designing things. It's not only designing things. It's actually designing badly over and over until it gets better."*

**Reality-Based Teaching**:
*"There's rare occasions when good or even great design might happen like at the drop of a hat, but usually that doesn't actually happen. That's not really the way great design works."*

*"Most of the great design that I've ever done starts out as bad design. It starts out with just putting things on the page and making it better, slowly refining it, iterating it"*

**Metaphorical Explanation**:
*"There's a quote that I love from Penn and Teller, and it says, 'Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect.'"*

*"The same way that you would go into the gym and start working out for the first time after you haven't done it in a while or if you've never done it, it's gonna be painful when you first get started."*

## üéØ Assignment/Homework Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Clear directive, specific constraints, encouraging challenge

**Assignment Introduction**:
*"So for homework, I want you to choose a design software, if you haven't already. And just to get the ball rolling, I want you to go ahead and design a small contact card for yourself"*

**Specific Constraints**:
*"on an 800 x 600 canvas, which is just happens to be the size of a Dribble shot, wink wink. And I want you to include an avatar of yourself, your name, Twitter, IG, Dribble handle, a button for contacting you via email."*

**Constraint Freedom**:
*"You get to choose your own typeface, layout, color, and style. Just don't spend more than like 30 minutes to an hour on this."*

**Action-Oriented Delivery**:
*"So for homework, I want you to pick two or three designs that you really like and screenshot them with Command + shift + three on the Mac, or however you take screenshots."*

*"And see if you can really nail it down to be exact sizes pretty, I mean, as close as you possibly can"*

## üí™ Encouragement/Motivation Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Empathetic support, honest about difficulty, growth-focused

**Acknowledging Fear and Difficulty**:
*"It can be scary, I know, to post your work publicly, but honestly, there is really no downside. You're only gonna get better by exposing yourself to more critique."*

*"I know that design is hard, but it only gets easier. You just have to trust the process and put in the reps."*

**Confidence Building**:
*"Don't be afraid to post it on Dribble. You can always delete it or make it a low profile shot, but I think posting your work and getting feedback from me and a lot of other designers is gonna be a very quick way for you to ramp up your design skills."*

**Progress Reinforcement**:
*"And the more you can show that you're progressing, the better your profile's gonna look over time and you'll slowly start to build a bit of a portfolio."*

*"There's really not many downsides and you'll notice that once you start sharing, the fear of putting your work out there publicly will very quickly go away"*

## üîß Technical Demonstration Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Live narration, real-time problem solving, practical guidance

**Live Screen Work**:
*"So I'm going to just drag it right here in the Figma. These come in at 1125. So I usually just divide this by three in the width property panel to get it down to a one X size."*

*"So I'm gonna place this right here and I'm gonna hit the two key to make the opacity, got a 20%."*

**Real-Time Decision Making**:
*"I'm not sure how big this is. Maybe a hundred points. And you can see that this is definitely not regular weight. It's probably like thin."*

*"This is probably 17 again, or that actually it might be a little more, it might be 20. And let's put that back at regular."*

**Technical Shortcuts and Tips**:
*"if you hold Option + 0, you'll get the little degree marker."*
*"And it's really important to line up these, even though these are different types sizes, you always want your baseline to be aligned."*

## üóÇÔ∏è Process/Organization Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Systematic authority, best practices sharing, efficiency-focused

**System Introduction**:
*"When you're getting started on a new project, it can be really, really easy to get very disorganized. So in this particular video, I'm gonna cover my personal organization best practices"*

**Experience-Based Authority**:
*"Now, I've tried lots and lots of different variations of this over the years and I've been refining it and refining it, and after more than a decade, this is the folder structure of all folder structures for my design projects"*

**Benefit-Forward Explanation**:
*"and I wanna share it with you because I would love for you to adopt this and to start using it. It'll just make your life much easier"*

## üè≠ Industry/Professional Context

### **Voice Characteristics**: Balanced perspective, nuanced analysis, real-world awareness

**Industry Commentary**:
*"UX versus UI, the age old discussion and our beloved industry? Well, this industry has specific jargon for nearly every single possible aspect of design. And not everyone always agrees."*

**Perspective Setting**:
*"So just for our pure convenience, I'm gonna give you my own point of view. And you can ponder this and you can understand the mental place that I'm gonna come from as we approach this material."*

**Balanced Analysis**:
*"First of all, I don't love the separation of the terms UX and UI as a fundamental practice. The separation implies that one can exist without the other and I don't really believe that to be true."*

## üéØ Context Adaptation Rules

### **Warm Authority Patterns**

**For Course Beginnings**: Personal investment, honor, excitement
*"I am super excited to have you here. I'm honored that you've made a decision to invest in yourself"*

**For Concept Introduction**: Reality-based, foundational, metaphorical
*"So before we really get started, I wanna tell you the secret of getting better at design. And the secret is not really a secret."*

**For Assignment Delivery**: Clear constraints, specific deliverables, encouraging challenges
*"So for homework, I want you to..."*

### **Empathy-Driven Support Patterns**

**For Acknowledging Difficulty**: "I know that design is hard, but it only gets easier"
**For Addressing Fear**: "It can be scary, I know, to post your work publicly, but honestly, there is really no downside"
**For Building Confidence**: "Don't be afraid to post it on Dribble. You can always delete it"

### **Technical Authority Patterns**

**For Live Demonstration**: Real-time narration with decision transparency
**For Process Sharing**: Experience-based authority with systematic structure
**For Industry Analysis**: Balanced perspective with personal viewpoint clarity

### **Consistent Core Elements Across All Teaching Contexts**
- Direct, encouraging tone
- Specific, actionable guidance
- Personal experience integration
- Reality-based examples
- Process-oriented thinking
- Student empathy and support
