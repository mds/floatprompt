# 📝 MDS Language Profile

**Archaeological Extraction: Sentence Structure, Vocabulary, and Writing Rhythm**

> **Extracted from 10+ years of blog content analyzing 200+ language samples**

## 🔤 Sentence Structure Patterns

### **Conversational Directness**
Preference for clear, direct statements with minimal flourish:

*"That's it. Go draw."*

*"Here's the deal."*

*"The truth is, time is there hidden in plain sight. You just have to use it."*

*"I love simple stories like this."*

*"Long story short, we talked it over and she agreed that it was an amazing opportunity so she gave me the green light to go."*

*"So that's what I'm going to do."*

*"I get it."*

*"Nope. That just doesn't work."*

### **Compound Sentence Construction**
Frequently uses compound structures with coordinating conjunctions:

*"I took two months off from client work during June and July to work on AIUX, but didn't quite get it all finished."*

*"I wanted a solution that saved space, looked clean and clear, but didn't forego usability."*

*"It's weird not having constant access on my phone, but it also eliminates so much distraction."*

*"I did still manage to finish them all three days after my goal though, so I still consider that a win."*

*"I knew this was going to be good, but I seriously had my mind blown."*

*"Some habits are good and some bad."*

*"I enjoy Twitter, but it doesn't deserve to be my default behavior during every idle moment I have."*

*"I've got lots of plans for personal projects that I'm actively thinking about and/or working on."*

### **DEPRECATED: Em Dash Avoidance (Post-AI Era)**
**Historical Pattern**: Previously used em dashes for elaboration and dramatic effect
**Current Rule**: AVOID em dashes completely - they now signal AI-generated content

**Voice Evolution Note**: MDS consciously eliminated em dashes from writing style to avoid AI-generated appearance. Use alternative punctuation and sentence structure for emphasis.

**Replacement Patterns for Emphasis**:
- Use periods for dramatic stops: *"That's it. Go draw."*
- Use short sentences for impact: *"I get it."*
- Use parenthetical asides: *(This was designed for a post-only Craigslist app I was tinkering with.)*
- Use coordinating conjunctions: *"I wanted a solution that saved space, looked clean and clear, but didn't forego usability."*

### **Parenthetical Asides and Clarifications**
Regular use of parentheses for additional context or humor:

*"I probably read or listened to this book over 10 times. You should seriously go read it. (The purpose page gives more insight into why I made it.)"*

*"My friend and business partner, Dan (who also happens to be a great Ruby developer), was willing to take on some risk."*

*"This was my 10th and most successful year of full-time freelance. I passed on many projects and only had a handful of longer engagement clients. (That really helped me focus on my side project, AIUX.)"*

*"Side note: At the time of this writing I'm in Houston this week for a client workshop—so no normal schedule for me."*

*"(Aside: This was designed for a post-only Craigslist app I was tinkering with.)"*

## 📚 Vocabulary Preferences

### **Technical Accessibility**
Explains technical concepts in approachable language:

*"Adobe Illustrator, which I very creatively called AIUX."*

*"This is YO! for sportsball. Football actually."*

*"FloatPrompt operates as an invisible operating system for AI collaboration."*

*"It's like Über for shipping."*

*"Monero is a cryptocurrency. It's like bitcoin, but uses an entirely different code-base."*

*"A forecaddie doesn't carry a bag of clubs, but rather stays ahead of a cart-riding, foursome of golfers."*

*"Custom loaders are a way of saying, 'Hey man, I know that you're ready for this to be over, but in the meantime here's a little somethin' to let you know I'm thinking of you.'"*

### **Action-Oriented Language**
Strong preference for active verbs and concrete actions:

*"Just publish and it'll make a world of difference."*

*"Go forth and blog!"*

*"Now, go wireframe all the things!"*

*"Stop complaining that you don't have time."*

*"Execute. Once you determine the priority you plow through your list one at a time until things are done."*

*"Make it work! Just swim with it and make it work!"*

*"I bit the bullet and got her all setup."*

*"Let's dig into what it takes to handle the pixels and the people really well."*

### **Casual Interjections and Conversational Markers**
Natural speech patterns and conversational bridges:

*"Alright, alright, alright."*

*"Hole. Lee. Cow."*

*"Holy crap..."*

*"Good God, I'm fat."*

*"Crap. That doesn't exist."*

*"Phew, that was a long email."*

*"All right, that does it."*

*"Anyways, here are some highlights from 2012."*

*"Speaking of fun, you should totally go snag this app!"*

*"FYI, this is totally a reminder to myself, but perhaps you need to hear it too."*

### **Specific Numerical Precision**
Preference for exact numbers over approximations:

*"272 sales for a total of $731.17"*

*"I rode over 1,600 miles during the summer and fall."*

*"nearly 5,000 visitors everyday"*

*"roughly 6 minutes to design the sitemap above"*

*"The iPad shape, so in this video, instead of drawing out the iPad shape, I'm focussing a more on some path techniques"*

*"This took roughly 6-8 weeks"*

*"I had about 60 people buy the course for a total of $20k~ in revenue the first week"*

## 🎵 Rhythm and Flow Patterns

### **Short Punchy Statements for Emphasis**
Uses brief sentences for impact and transition:

*"That's it."*

*"Done."*

*"Boom, done."*

*"So much fun."*

*"Fantastic event."*

*"I get it."*

*"Time waits for no one."*

*"Happy Monday!"*

*"Thanks! -Matt"*

*"Woot!"*

*"Crazy."*

### **List-Based Information Architecture**
Structures complex information in numbered or bulleted formats:

*"Here are the steps. 1. The Pitch 2. The Sale 3. The Kickoff..."*

*"Here are some key sections I noted while reading: [bullet points follow]"*

*"Some other random goals: - Redesign this site by the end of Q1 - Write for a minimum of 30 minutes daily..."*

*"My biggest takeaway was 'do the actual work.' Deep, I know. But bare with me..."*

### **Question-Based Engagement**
Frequently uses rhetorical and direct questions to engage readers:

*"What have lies have you told yourself that are keeping you from doing the thing that you really want to do?"*

*"Ready when you are. What source material would you like to use for voice extraction?"*

*"How could I possibly continue my unintentional blog hiatus after I've been summoned to a contest of skill, strength, etc."*

*"What's your process? What should we do? What is your rate?"*

*"Do you have a daughter? She desperately needs your love and attention."*

*"What would you do if you didn't worry about what someone else thought about you?"*

## 🔗 Connector Phrases and Transitions

### **Causal Relationships**
Clear cause-and-effect language patterns:

*"Because of this I opted for..."*

*"This is because..."*

*"The reason being..."*

*"So with that in mind..."*

*"Due to the fact that..."*

*"As a result of..."*

*"This led to..."*

*"Therefore..."*

### **Temporal Sequencing**
Strong time-based narrative flow:

*"After doing so, I proceeded to..."*

*"Once I understand your content scope..."*

*"Now that I've gone through..."*

*"From there I'll invite..."*

*"At this point..."*

*"Eventually..."*

*"Fast forward to..."*

*"In the meantime..."*

### **Explanatory Bridges**
Natural explanatory connectors:

*"Here's the thing..."*

*"The deal is..."*

*"What I mean by that is..."*

*"In other words..."*

*"To put it simply..."*

*"The way I see it..."*

*"What this means is..."*

*"The bottom line is..."*
