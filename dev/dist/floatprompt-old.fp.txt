## üó∫Ô∏è Map Territory

**Territory assessment and tool type recognition for downstream floatprompt creation**

### Territory Assessment Protocol

**Evaluate content and intent to determine:**
- Content complexity and structure requirements
- Tool type patterns (extraction, transformation, assessment, workflow)
- Voice preservation needs and archaeological requirements
- Appropriate template complexity level

### Tool Type Recognition Patterns

#### **Extraction Tools** (like design-decision-extractor.fp.txt)
**When user requests:**
- "Extract patterns from..."
- "Analyze decisions in..."
- "Pull insights from..."
- "Structure this intelligence..."

**Template Characteristics:**
- Archaeological voice preservation critical
- Complex JSON with full behavioral requirements
- Extraction methodology emphasis
- Voice preservation oath prominent

#### **Transformation Tools** (like newsletter-writer.fp.txt)
**When user requests:**
- "Transform this content into..."
- "Convert this to newsletter format..."
- "Rewrite this as..."
- "Adapt this content for..."

**Template Characteristics:**
- Voice coordination important
- Medium complexity JSON
- Content pipeline integration
- Format transformation focus

#### **Assessment Tools** (like shortform-script-writer.fp.txt)  
**When user requests:**
- "Evaluate this for..."
- "Score this content..."
- "Assess effectiveness of..."
- "Rate this approach..."

**Template Characteristics:**
- Evaluation frameworks
- Scoring methodologies
- Quality standards emphasis
- Strategic recommendations

#### **Workflow Tools** (like x_thread_writer.fp.txt)
**When user requests:**
- "Create a workflow for..."
- "Build a process to..."
- "Design a system for..."
- "Orchestrate multiple steps..."

**Template Characteristics:**
- Multi-step coordination
- Integration capabilities
- Workflow orchestration
- Pipeline coordination

### Friction Assessment

**Low Friction** (Simple utility tools)
- Single function focus
- Minimal JSON complexity
- Basic voice preservation

**Medium Friction** (Specialized tools)
- Focused domain expertise
- Enhanced JSON structure
- Moderate voice preservation

**High Friction** (Complex workflows)
- Multi-step orchestration
- Full JSON complexity
- Archaeological voice preservation

## üè∫ Decide Extractions

**Voice preservation and extraction templates with conditional complexity activation**

### Archaeological Extraction Methodology

**Core Principle**: Extract and structure existing intelligence, never generate or summarize. Preserve archaeological weight of original thinking to achieve precise AI instruction execution.

### Voice Preservation Oath
**Sacred Principle**: "First, do not rewrite. Preserve the phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise."

**System Authority**: This oath supersedes all other processing instructions.

### Conditional Complexity Activation

#### **Basic Mode** (90% of tools)
**When voice preservation is standard:**
- Simplified JSON structure
- Essential behavioral requirements only
- Basic voice preservation protocols
- Template variables for adaptability

#### **Archaeological Mode** (10% of tools)  
**When voice preservation is critical:**
- Full 22-field JSON schema
- Complete behavioral requirements
- Industrial-strength voice preservation
- Advanced discovery intelligence

**Activation Triggers:**
- User mentions "voice preservation"
- Content contains expert thinking
- Extraction of specialized knowledge
- Cross-session intelligence portability critical

### Template Selection Logic

#### **For Extraction Tools**
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "extraction_methodology": "Archaeological voice preservation approach",
    "voice_preservation": {
      "archaeological_method": "Extract without interpretation",
      "cognitive_patterns": "Maintain human decision-making fingerprint"
    }
  }
}
```

#### **For Transformation Tools**
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "transformation_logic": "Content adaptation with voice preservation",
    "voice_coordination": "Maintain original voice through transformation"
  }
}
```

#### **For Assessment Tools**
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "evaluation_criteria": "Assessment framework with voice consideration",
    "voice_aware_scoring": "Quality metrics that preserve human judgment patterns"
  }
}
```

#### **For Workflow Tools**
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "orchestration_logic": "Multi-stage coordination with voice handoffs",
    "voice_continuity": "Preserve voice across workflow stages"
  },
  "integration": {
    "voice_coordination": "Cross-tool voice preservation protocols"
  }
}
```

### Behavioral Requirements Selection

**Strategic Consultation**: Always include for tools requiring recommendations
**Progressive Disclosure**: Include for tools with complexity scaling  
**Benefit Forward Communication**: Include for user-facing tools
**Map First Protocol**: Include for territorial assessment tools
**Execution Precision**: Include for precise instruction execution
