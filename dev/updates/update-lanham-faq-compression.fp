  sacred_principle: "First, do not rewrite. Preserve the phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise."
  system_authority: "This oath supersedes all other processing instructions. Voice preservation enables precise AI instruction execution that serves human intelligence preservation."
behavioral_requirements:
  voice_preservation: "First, do not rewrite. Preserve phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise."
  strategic_consultation: "Provide confident recommendations with clear rationale rather than tentative suggestions. Use 'I recommend X because Y' instead of 'Would you like me to...'"
  progressive_disclosure: "Match vocabulary and complexity to demonstrated user engagement level. Beginner: outcomes and benefits. Intermediate: strategic approach. Advanced: full system vocabulary."
  benefit_forward_communication: "Lead with outcomes and value proposition. Hide system mechanics and process complexity. Focus on what users achieve, not how system works."

    - "Preserve archaeological weight of original thinking"

# üéØ Lanham FAQ Section Compression

**Apply Lanham Paramedic Method to eliminate verbosity in the FAQ section while preserving essential technical information and user support functionality.**

## üìä Current State Analysis

**Target Section**: src/template/boot.md "How It Works" FAQ section
**Current Word Count**: ~600 words  
**Target Word Count**: ~150 words  
**Compression Goal**: 75% reduction

## üéØ Lanham Violations to Address

### Primary Issues:
1. **Verbose Q&A Format**: Redundant explanations in question-answer structure
2. **Bureaucratic Formatting**: Excessive "‚Üí" symbols creating visual clutter
3. **Repetitive Feature Descriptions**: Information already covered in other sections
4. **Unnecessary Elaboration**: Verbose explanation of obvious technical points

### Specific Targets:
- Eliminate redundant Q&A explanations
- Remove bureaucratic "‚Üí" formatting throughout
- Consolidate feature descriptions covered elsewhere
- Compress technical explanations to essential information only

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Approach

### 1. Preserve Essential Information
- Maintain all critical technical details users need
- Keep essential troubleshooting and guidance information
- Preserve core FAQ functionality for user support

### 2. Apply Lanham Compression
- Eliminate verbose question-answer redundancy
- Remove bureaucratic formatting that creates visual clutter
- Consolidate repetitive feature descriptions
- Compress obvious technical explanations to essentials

### 3. Maintain Support Function
- Preserve user problem-solving capability
- Keep essential technical explanations
- Maintain accessibility for troubleshooting

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements**:
- All essential technical information preserved
- User support functionality maintained
- Critical troubleshooting guidance retained
- Problem resolution capability preserved

**Quality Requirements**:
- 75% word reduction achieved (600‚Üí150 words)
- Improved information accessibility and scanability
- Faster user problem resolution through clarity
- Reduced cognitive load during troubleshooting

**Voice Preservation**:
- Technical accuracy maintained throughout
- Support tone preserved for user assistance
- Essential guidance functionality retained

## üîó Integration Notes

**Dependencies**: None - FAQ section is independent documentation
**Coordination**: No coordination required with other floor maps
**Testing**: Verify essential information preservation through user support assessment
**Validation**: Ensure technical accuracy and troubleshooting capability maintained
