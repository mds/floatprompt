# Updates

Update specifications and records for FloatPrompt system changes.

## Subfolders

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **closed/** | Completed updates (archived) |
| **in-progress/** | Active updates being worked on |

## Workflow

1. Create update spec using `../update-creator.md`
2. Place in `in-progress/`
3. Execute using `../update-protocol.md`
4. Move to `closed/` when complete

## Principles

- Territory assessment before changes
- Validate against goal hierarchy
- Human approval required
- Maintain rollback capability
- Archaeological record of all changes

See parent folder for update-creator.md and update-protocol.md tools.
