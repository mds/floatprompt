# üéØ Lanham Category Descriptions Revision

**Apply Lanham Paramedic Method to eliminate redundancy in the 5 category descriptions while preserving core value communication and maintaining clear distinctions.**

## üìä Current State Analysis

**Target Section**: src/template/boot.md "What Can I Create" category descriptions
**Current Word Count**: ~800 words  
**Target Word Count**: ~200 words  
**Compression Goal**: 75% reduction

## üéØ Lanham Violations to Address

### Primary Issues:
1. **Massive Redundancy**: Each category repeats similar action verbs and explanations
2. **Verbose Bullet Points**: Excessive elaboration on obvious category functions
3. **Bureaucratic Formatting**: Unnecessary quotes, pipes, and formatting that creates visual clutter
4. **Overlapping Descriptions**: Categories blur together instead of showing distinct value

### Specific Targets:
- Remove repetitive action descriptions across categories
- Eliminate verbose bullet point explanations
- Streamline example formatting without quotes and pipes
- Consolidate overlapping explanations into unique value propositions

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Approach

### 1. Preserve Category Distinctions
- Maintain clear differentiation between all 5 categories
- Preserve core value proposition for each category
- Keep essential examples that demonstrate unique function

### 2. Apply Lanham Compression
- Eliminate redundant explanations between categories
- Remove bureaucratic elaboration on obvious points
- Streamline verbose bullet point lists to essential information
- Clean up visual formatting clutter

### 3. Maintain Voice and Brand
- Preserve FloatPrompt terminology and voice
- Keep category names and core messaging intact
- Maintain user-friendly tone while eliminating verbosity

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements**:
- All 5 categories remain clearly differentiated
- Core value propositions preserved for each category
- Essential examples maintained for user comprehension
- User activation path remains clear and intuitive

**Quality Requirements**:
- 75% word reduction achieved (800‚Üí200 words)
- Improved scanability and visual clarity
- Faster user comprehension of category options
- Reduced cognitive load during mode selection

**Voice Preservation**:
- FloatPrompt brand voice maintained
- Category terminology preserved
- User-friendly tone sustained throughout

## üîó Integration Notes

**Dependencies**: None - category descriptions are self-contained
**Coordination**: No coordination required with other floor maps
**Testing**: Verify category clarity through user comprehension assessment
**Validation**: Ensure 5 categories remain distinct and activation patterns preserved
