    # FloatPrompt Enforcement Update Protocol
    Update existing FloatPrompt files to prevent inline chat output and ensure reliable artifact creation across all AI systems.

    ## Quick Start
    1. Open your FloatPrompt .txt file in Cursor
    2. Find the "requirements" section in the JSON block
    3. Add the enforcement block as the first requirement
    4. Save and test with your AI system

    ## Goals
    - Prevent ChatGPT from outputting FloatPrompts inline in chat
    - Stop urgent language from overriding artifact creation rules
    - Ensure consistent downloadable file creation across all AI platforms
    - Maintain existing FloatPrompt functionality while adding protection

    ## Context
    Use this update when you notice AI systems displaying FloatPrompts in chat instead of creating downloadable files. This commonly happens when humans use urgent language like "give it to me now quickly" which can override structured creation guidelines.

    ## Output
    Updated FloatPrompt files with enhanced enforcement rules that create explicit behavioral anchors against urgency-based overrides. AI systems will consistently create downloadable files and request clarification when conflicting instructions are given.

    ## Warnings
    - Always validate JSON syntax after adding the enforcement block
    - Place enforcement as the first item in requirements section
    - Do not modify existing tool-specific functionality
    - Test updated FloatPrompt with your AI system to confirm proper behavior
