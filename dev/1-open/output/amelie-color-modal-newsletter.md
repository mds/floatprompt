# **The 3-Line Rule That Changed How I Think About UI Design**

*How one modal critique revealed the hidden connection between content strategy and visual hierarchy*

---

Last week, I was reviewing a beautifully designed modal alert when something caught my attention. The designer had nailed the layout, colors, spacing, and alignment. Everything felt really strong from a visual design perspective.

But there was this 5-line block of text that felt... heavy.

Not bad. Not wrong. Just heavy enough to compete with the modal's clean hierarchy.

That's when I realized something that's changed how I approach every UI component since: **content strategy and visual design aren't separate disciplines—they're the same discipline.**

## **The Real Problem Isn't Long Copy**

Here's what most designers miss: **every line of text has visual weight in your interface hierarchy.**

When you write "Setting a general color direction early will help you make additional color decisions more easily throughout your design process and will provide better consistency," you're not just delivering information. You're adding visual density that affects the entire component's balance.

Think about it like this: your modal has a job to do. Alert the user, get a response, get out of the way. But when your content needs 5 lines to explain something, it's competing with that efficiency.

The solution isn't to avoid helpful information. It's to **treat content length as a design decision.**

## **The 3-Line Maximum Framework**

Here's the systematic approach I now use for alert components:

**3 lines maximum for modal alerts**
- Forces content clarity and precision
- Maintains visual hierarchy balance
- Improves user scanning efficiency

**Content condensation methodology**
- Strip unnecessary qualifiers and explanations
- Focus on immediate action or understanding
- Save detailed explanations for dedicated help sections

**Typography hierarchy support**
- Reduce font weight on body content when needed
- Let content and typography decisions reinforce each other
- Never solve content problems with visual tricks

For that modal? "Setting a general color direction early will help you make additional color decisions more easily." Same value, half the visual complexity.

## **Why This Changes Everything for Your Career**

When you start treating content as visual design, three things happen:

1. **Your interfaces feel intentionally crafted** instead of accidentally assembled
2. **Clients see you as a strategic thinker** who considers the complete user experience
3. **Your design decisions become systematically defensible** with clear methodology

This isn't about becoming a UX writer. It's about **understanding that every element in your interface serves the user experience.**

I like to think about copywriting and delivering messages in the UI just as important as the UI themselves. When you approach content with the same systematic thinking you apply to spacing and color, your entire design practice gets stronger.

**The best designers don't just make things look good—they make sure every element earns its place.**

When you can explain why your content choices support your design goals, you're not just someone who makes interfaces prettier. You're a systematic thinker who solves complete user experience problems.
