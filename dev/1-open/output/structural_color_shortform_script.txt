Let me show you two tiny changes that make this design feel even more polished.

This is from one of my Shift Nudge students' structural color exercise - it's already working really well, but let's see how we can refine it.

First change: we've got five lines of text in this alert.

When you have five lines like this, that might feel like too much text to read.

If we could reduce this to three lines, that would be a safe maximum for scanning UX copy.

Usually an alert would be something condensed like this.

Second change: I think we could go one or two font weights lower on this body copy.

That would strengthen the hierarchy here.

The overall layout looks good, the colors look good, the spacing and alignment - all of it feels really strong.

But this text adjustment would give it that extra polish.

So there you have it: reduce this copy to three lines, drop the font weight.

Those two changes alone can help guide more decisions in the future.

Simple refinements that make a big difference.
