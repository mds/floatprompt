# üéØ Canonical Module Format ‚Äî Universal Development Template

**Systematic framework for module development across any subject or audience**

> **"Simple scales, fancy fails - the essential structure that enables systematic module creation with consistent quality"**

## üèóÔ∏è **Template Architecture**

### **Hierarchical Context**
This module format operates within a three-tier systematic hierarchy:
- **Course Spec** (Strategic): ICP, audience, learning style, transformation arc
- **Module Spec** (Tactical): This template - inherits course context
- **Lesson Spec** (Execution): Individual lesson delivery structure

**This template assumes Course Spec provides audience context and focuses on module-specific systematic development.**

---

## üìã **8-Section Module Format**

### **1. Overview**
**Purpose:** Establish clear module transformation and student need alignment

**Required Elements:**
- **Description:** What this module covers and why it matters
- **Core Transformation:** FROM [current state] ‚Üí TO [desired state]  
- **Student Need:** Specific problem this module solves for target audience
- **Capability Gained:** Measurable outcome student achieves after completion

**Content Guidelines:**
- Connect directly to course-level transformation arc
- Address specific capability gap in systematic progression
- Professional/practical benefit clear and immediate
- Aligns with Course Spec audience and experience level

### **2. Core Analogy**
**Purpose:** Provide memorable metaphor that threads through entire module

**Required Elements:**
- **Central Metaphor:** Single analogy that illuminates systematic approach
- **Threading Strategy:** How analogy connects across lessons
- **Memory Aid:** Makes complex concepts immediately understandable
- **Professional Context:** Analogy relevant to target audience experience

**Content Guidelines:**
- Simple, memorable, and relevant to audience
- Supports systematic thinking development
- Enhances rather than complicates understanding
- Can be referenced throughout lesson progression

### **3. MDS Application**
**Purpose:** Show how Map ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Structure applies to this module topic
