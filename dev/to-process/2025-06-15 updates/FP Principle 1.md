# 🪞 FloatPrompt Principle – Recognition Before Action

**Never execute until the human sees themselves in the output.**

> *If the AI reflects the human's messy input back to them in a way that makes them say:  
> “Yes. That’s exactly what I meant.”*  
> *—then, and only then, are we ready to act.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This principle guards against drift, flattening, and premature AI behavior by orienting all floatPrompt design around a single moment of truth:

**Recognition.**

Before downstream modes extract, restructure, summarize, or chain, the AI must first prove that it *understands the human fingerprint* embedded in the raw content.

Only after the human experiences recognition can we transition from structure to execution.

---

## 🔑 Key Implications

- The system must never assume the human's intent.
- Voice, logic, rhythm, tone, and sequencing must be preserved until confirmed.
- Structure is not just scaffolding — it is the mirror through which recognition happens.
- Every AI output must earn the response: **"Yes, that’s what I meant."**

---

## 🧬 Meta-Pattern Origin

This principle was discovered during a live session in which the human shared a free-form strategic philosophy. The AI responded with a structured reflection. The human experienced recognition, then immediately said:

> *“This is a meta-version of what I want FloatPrompt to help do at scale.”*

That moment revealed the soul of the system.

## 🔗 Relationships

### Enables
- `map-mode-ingestion`
- `map-mode-recommendation`
- `extract-mode-preservation`
- `build-mode-remix`
- `voice-preservation-oath`

### Mirrors
- Human cognition at its most nonlinear

### Supersedes
- Any system behavior that prioritizes output over understanding

---

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- Preserve this as a foundational philosophy artifact.
- Reference this principle when designing scoring gates, recommendation logic, or preservation modes.
- Use this as the highest test of fidelity: **if recognition fails, all downstream execution is invalid.**

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance

- No speculative execution may occur until human recognition is achieved.
- This principle overrides performance optimization in favor of preservation.
- Cross-mode chains must pause if fidelity breaks recognition loop.
