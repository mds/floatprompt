# ðŸ§  Map Mode Context Dump

This document preserves the reasoning behind the creation of the FloatPrompt `map / score / plot` ingestion pipeline. It is not a spec, but a full-context snapshot of the conversation, philosophy, assumptions, decisions, and framing logic that led to the canonical ingestion floatPrompt.

## âœ… Purpose

- Preserve architectural design intent for future protocol authors
- Enable safe evolution of downstream artifacts like recommendation flows
- Avoid shallow replication by maintaining upstream decision visibility

## ðŸ§­ What We Did

### 1. Challenged the concept of Map Mode as optional
- Decided Map Mode must run on all input
- Reframed mapping as a diagnostic, not an execution step

### 2. Defined the purpose of `map / score / plot`
- A pre-action analysis layer that evaluates volume and structure
- Blocks premature extract/build behavior

### 3. Rejected intent as a scoring input
- Too fragile, inconsistent, and easily misleading
- May be useful for validation *after* scoring

### 4. Created the scoring algorithm
- Word count Ã— nonlinear structure multiplier
- Floor rules to enforce minimum friction for long or chaotic content
- Final score maps to 3 friction buckets

### 5. Aligned friction buckets with execution risk
| Score      | Bucket             | Risk Domain |
|------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 0â€“1200     | ðŸŸ© low-friction     | Safe to proceed or build |
| 1201â€“2500  | ðŸŸ¨ moderate-friction| Structure awareness needed |
| 2501+      | ðŸŸ¥ high-friction    | Mapping and voice preservation mandatory |

### 6. Answered Claude's key question
- Where does the structure score come from?
- Answer: It is generated by the `map` step itself, not provided by humans

### 7. Captured all logic into a canonical floatPrompt
- Title: `map-mode-ingestion.md`
- Score logic is now system-law, not speculative
- Future recommendations and spawns are constrained by this output

## ðŸ§  Why This Matters

- Prevents AI from drifting into high-trust output on unscored content
- Enables downstream modules (like extract/build/critique) to be safety-aware
- Anchors the "slowness at the start" principle as a system design law

## ðŸ“¦ Ready for Next Step

The ingestion layer is now closed. All future design work â€” especially output artifacts and recommendation systems â€” will build on this.
