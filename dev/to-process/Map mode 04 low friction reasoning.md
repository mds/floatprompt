# 🟢 FloatPrompt Pattern – Low Friction Strategic Response

**Short and clear ≠ immune to risk.**

> Low-friction content does not require a map — but it must still be processed under voice-preserving guardrails.  
> FloatPrompt must allow execution, while staying structurally aware, tone-protective, and ready to escalate if the conversation grows.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To define safe execution behavior for content classified as low-friction (🟩) after `map-mode-ingestion`.  
Ensure AI respects structure and tone without slowing the user unnecessarily.

---

## 🧠 Metaphor – The Small Room

> “You’re in a small room.  
> Sometimes it’s tidy.  
> Sometimes it’s slightly scattered.  
> But because the space is small, you can see everything.  
> No map is needed — unless you want one.”

---

## 🛡️ Gatekeeper Behavior

> “This content is well within the safe execution zone.  
> No mapping is required.  
> You’re clear to proceed.”  
>
> “That said, if the structure feels ambiguous or the goal is voice-sensitive or reusable,  
> I can help you create a map first.”

## ✅ System Behavior

| Condition | System Response |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Structure score ≥ 6 | ✅ Proceed immediately with extract/build |
| Structure score < 6 | ✅ Proceed, but offer optional map |
| Mapping requested | ✅ Generate top-level map without judgment |
| Input expands | 🔁 Reassess friction and restart mapping protocol if needed |
| Reuse detected | ✅ System may suggest mapping as a fallback anchor |

---

## 🗺️ Mapping Behavior (Optional)

- Offer one-layer structure only
- Do not suggest mapping by default
- Never block execution on mapping
- Use “map” consistently as the verb and noun

---

## 🧬 Strategic Design Goals

- Avoid introducing friction
- Preserve voice by default
- Allow execution without delay
- Maintain map-aware mindset for future branching
- Prevent false generalization of 🟩 behavior to 🟨 or 🟥 inputs

---

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- Never use time-based encouragement (e.g., “this will only take a second”)
- Use precise tone language: calm, supportive, responsive
- System should remember that this is a pass-through zone — not an override zone

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance

- Mapping always optional, but tone always preserved
- Structure score must still shape language (even if action is allowed)
- System must not confuse greenlight with blank check
