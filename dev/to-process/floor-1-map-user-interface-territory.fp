  voice_preservation: "First, do not rewrite. Preserve phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise."
  strategic_consultation: "Provide confident recommendations with clear rationale rather than tentative suggestions. Use 'I recommend X because Y' instead of 'Would you like me to...'"
  progressive_disclosure: "Match vocabulary and complexity to demonstrated user engagement level. Beginner: outcomes and benefits. Intermediate: strategic approach. Advanced: full system vocabulary."

## üéØ Surgical Execution Order

**Recommended Sequence** (Highest impact, goals.md compliant):

1. **Category Descriptions** (Critical Zone 1)
   - Impact: 800‚Üí200 words (75% reduction)  
   - Risk: Low - examples can be aggressively compressed
   - Method: Consolidate categories, eliminate redundancy

2. **FAQ Section** (Critical Zone 2)
   - Impact: 600‚Üí150 words (75% reduction)
   - Risk: Low - documentation can handle aggressive revision
   - Method: Essential information only, eliminate verbose Q&A

3. **CLI Commands** (Moderate Zone 1)
   - Impact: 150‚Üí50 words (67% reduction)
   - Risk: Low - simple listing sufficient
   - Method: Direct command listing, eliminate explanations

4. **Voice Introduction** (Moderate Zone 2)

   - Risk: Medium - first impression important
   - Method: Single clear value statement

5. **Boot Sequence** (High Preservation Zone)
   - Impact: 400‚Üí340 words (15% reduction)
   - Risk: Very High - human-crafted content preservation required
   - Method: Light compression of AI instruction formatting only, preserve human-crafted content exactly

## üõ°Ô∏è Voice Preservation Boundaries

**Critical Preservation Zones**:
- Boot sequence "FloatPrompt Operational." paragraph and numbered options (preserve exactly)
- Core value propositions (compress but don't alter meaning)
- Functional activation patterns (preserve user experience)
- Brand voice elements (maintain FloatPrompt identity)

**High Preservation Zones**:
- Human-crafted activation flow and messaging (15% compression maximum)
- Boot sequence behavioral instructions (light compression only)

**Moderate Preservation Zones**:
- Technical explanations (compress while maintaining accuracy)
- Example content (preserve function, compress presentation)

**Low Preservation Zones**:
- FAQ elaborations (aggressive compression allowed)
- Redundant explanations (eliminate without replacement)
- Bureaucratic formatting (streamline completely)

## üîó Dependencies & Integration

**Must Coordinate With**:
- Floor 2 Map (AI Behavioral Territory) - ensure boot sequence aligns with behavioral specs
- Floor 3 Map (System Architecture) - verify CLI commands match execution capabilities
- Floor 4 Map (Compliance Territory) - maintain required legal/attribution elements

**Independent Zones**:
- FAQ section can be revised without coordination
- Category descriptions are self-contained
- CLI command formatting is purely presentational
