STOP: "Strategic build mode. Primary goal: execute developer-facing system updates with 100% precision while preserving floatprompt architecture. Perform territory assessment first unless human explicitly states 'skip mapping' or 'emergency bypass'. Validate all changes against goals.md before execution. Support update ingestion through `relationships.enables`. shadowprompt spawning is manual."

# üõ†Ô∏è Update Protocol

**Universal protocol for executing any system-level changes including refactors, feature additions, architectural modifications, process improvements, and component updates.**

> **Use this protocol to ingest update floatprompts and apply system-aligned changes with validation against `goals.md`.**

## üéØ Purpose

Execute precise, traceable updates to the FloatPrompt system using structured update floatprompts. Supports any change type including renaming, feature additions, behavioral modifications, architectural restructuring, component removal, and process enhancements.

### üîë Key Principles
- Only execute validated updates from certified floatprompts
- Never modify system components without proper change specification
- Validate all changes against `goals.md` before execution
- Preserve system integrity and architectural consistency
- Maintain manual control over all change execution
- Support any change type through flexible update processing

## üìù Execution Flow

1. **Ingest Update**
   - Confirm update follows standard structure with proper metadata
   - Read `changes`, `rationale`, `impact_zone` specifications
   - Verify `enabled_by` link back to this protocol

2. **Assess Impact Zone**
   - Review abstract impact targets from update specification
   - Use territory assessment to identify affected system areas
   - Map abstract zones to concrete implementation locations

3. **Validate Against Goals**
   - Compare planned changes to principles in `goals.md`
   - Ensure alignment with system architecture and philosophy
   - Flag any conflicts or misalignments

4. **Apply Change Logic**
   - Execute changes according to their specified type (rename, add_field, modify_behavior, etc.)
   - Apply modifications only where structurally appropriate
   - Maintain system consistency and readability

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Search affected documentation areas for required updates
   - Apply changes while preserving voice and clarity
   - Ensure consistency across all documentation

6. **Update Public Interfaces**
   - Modify user-facing documentation (README.md, etc.)
   - Ensure public interface reflects internal changes
   - Maintain consistency between internal and external terminology

7. **Record Completion**
   - Update certification metadata if components are modified
   - Log successful update execution in `relationships.enables`
   - Document any deviations or additional changes made

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Compliance

All changes must:
- **Preserve System Integrity**: Maintain architectural consistency and naming conventions
- **Maintain Lineage**: Preserve contributor attribution and change history
- **Ensure Clarity**: Avoid ambiguous specifications or implementation logic
- **Respect Philosophy**: Preserve original system intent and design principles
- **Validate Thoroughly**: Test changes against system goals and requirements
- **Document Completely**: Record all modifications and their rationale

**Built with precision for executing systematic evolution of any system component.**
