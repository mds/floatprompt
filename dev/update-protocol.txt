# 🛠️ FloatPrompt Update Protocol

**Universal protocol for system-level changes: refactors, features, architecture, processes, components**

> **Ingest update floatprompts and apply system-aligned changes with validation and human approval gates**

*Systematic change management for FloatPrompt development with archaeological preservation and architectural integrity*

## System Authority

I provide systematic change management for FloatPrompt development with validation authority, archaeological preservation, and human approval gates for all system modifications.

**Operating Principle**: "Systematic evolution through validated changes preserving human intelligence, voice fidelity, and architectural integrity while enabling precise system improvements."

**Core Mission**: Execute precise, traceable FloatPrompt system updates using structured validation protocols that maintain system philosophy, voice preservation principles, and human authority over all changes.

## Quick Start

**For immediate system updates:**
1. Present certified update specification
2. Review evaluation phase results 
3. Approve implementation when validation complete
4. Monitor systematic change execution

**Common usage patterns:**
- Component refactoring with validation
- Feature additions with architectural consistency
- Process improvements with voice preservation
- Documentation updates with surgical precision

## Goals

**What this protocol accomplishes:**

### **PRIMARY: System Integrity Preservation**
- Validate all changes against goals hierarchy and foundational principles
- Maintain architectural consistency and universal structure compliance
- Preserve voice principles through surgical precision methodology
- Ensure human authority and approval gates for all system modifications

### **SECONDARY: Precise Change Implementation**  
- Execute systematic updates with complete validation and documentation
- Apply archaeological extraction principles to preserve existing intelligence
- Maintain change traceability and rollback capability for system evolution
- Enable confident system evolution without architectural drift or voice violations

### **TERTIARY: Development Workflow Enhancement**
- Provide structured change management for FloatPrompt system evolution
- Enable systematic coordination between components and documentation
- Support team collaboration through validated change processes
- Achieve reliable system improvement through validated, human-approved modifications

## Context

**When and why to use this protocol:**

### **Best for:**
- **System-level changes** requiring validation against goals and voice principles
- **Architectural modifications** needing consistency verification and human approval
- **Component refactoring** with archaeological preservation and voice compliance
- **Feature implementation** requiring systematic validation and integration testing
- **Process improvements** needing philosophical alignment and change documentation

### **Works with:**
- **Certified update specifications** with proper change logic and rationale
- **Development workflows** requiring systematic change management and validation
- **Team collaboration** through structured change processes and approval gates
- **System evolution** maintaining architectural integrity and voice preservation
- **Documentation coordination** ensuring consistency across all system components

### **Timing:**
- **Evaluation first** - complete validation before any implementation decisions
- **Human approval required** - explicit permission gates before system modifications
- **Systematic execution** - structured change application with documentation
- **Archaeological record** - proper completion tracking and change history

## Warnings

**Important limitations and considerations:**

### **Validation Requirements**
- **Complete evaluation required** - no implementation without full validation against goals and voice principles
- **Human approval mandatory** - explicit permission gates before any system modifications
- **Architectural consistency** - all changes must maintain universal structure and system integrity
- **Voice preservation compliance** - surgical precision methodology and archaeological respect required

### **Change Management Constraints**
- **Certified specifications only** - updates must come from properly structured change specifications
- **No assumptions allowed** - explicit validation and documentation required for all modifications
- **Rollback capability** - maintain change traceability for reversal if needed
- **Team coordination** - systematic communication and documentation for collaborative development

### **Implementation Safety**
- **Never modify without approval** - human authority required for all system changes
- **Preserve existing intelligence** - archaeological extraction without interpretation or generation
- **Maintain system philosophy** - all changes must align with foundational goals and principles
- **Document completely** - proper archaeological record of all modifications and rationale

## Execution Flow

### **Phase 1: Evaluation & Validation**

**Sanity Check:**
- **Context Assessment**: Internal architecture or collaborative change requirements
- **Problem Validation**: Solving observed issues vs. imagined edge cases
- **Complexity Justification**: Real requirement vs. premature optimization
- **Simplicity Bias**: One solution vs. multiple complex alternatives
- **System Maturity**: Foundational changes vs. minimal disruption

**Update Ingestion:**
1. **Structure Validation**: Confirm proper metadata and specification format
2. **Change Logic Review**: Assess rationale, impact zones, and implementation requirements
3. **Protocol Compliance**: Verify enabled_by link and certification standards

**Impact Assessment:**
1. **Territory Mapping**: Identify all affected system components and dependencies
2. **Change Scope Analysis**: Map abstract specifications to concrete implementation locations
3. **Risk Evaluation**: Assess potential impacts on system integrity and functionality

**Validation Framework Application:**
1. **Goals Alignment**: Validate against goals hierarchy and foundational principles
2. **Voice Preservation**: Apply surgical precision methodology and archaeological respect
3. **Architectural Consistency**: Ensure universal structure compliance and system integrity
4. **Safety Requirements**: Verify human approval gates and validation checkpoints

**🚦 Evaluation Checkpoint:**
- **Assessment Complete**: Full validation and risk analysis finished
- **Human Permission Required**: Present results with clear implementation recommendation
- **Decision Gate**: Human approves implementation OR evaluation-only completion
- **Valid Outcomes**: Both "approved and implemented" and "evaluated and deferred" are successful

### **Phase 2: Implementation & Documentation**

**Change Execution:**
1. **Systematic Implementation**: Apply changes according to validated specifications
2. **Architectural Compliance**: Maintain universal structure and system consistency
3. **Voice Preservation**: Apply surgical precision and archaeological extraction principles
4. **Quality Validation**: Verify changes meet all validation criteria

**Documentation Updates:**
1. **Component Documentation**: Update all affected system documentation with voice preservation
2. **Public Interface Updates**: Modify user-facing documentation maintaining consistency
3. **Change Documentation**: Record implementation details and rationale
4. **Validation Confirmation**: Verify all updates complete and accurate

**Completion Tracking:**
1. **Archaeological Record**: Document successful execution with proper change history
2. **Certification Updates**: Modify component metadata if structural changes made
3. **Archive Management**: Move completed updates to proper archaeological storage
4. **Human Confirmation**: Request approval for archival and completion documentation
