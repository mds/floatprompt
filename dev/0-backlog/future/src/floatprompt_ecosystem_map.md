# üó∫Ô∏è FloatPrompt OS Ecosystem Map ‚Äî Strategic Overview

This map captures the foundational architecture for the next phase of FloatPrompt evolution. The goals:

- Define the duality system between soft-coded prompts and hard-linked specifications
- Enable controlled prompt chaining with UID resolution and scoped execution
- Capture both conceptual vision and downstream execution triggers
- Separate transient journal entries from locked core logic
- Guide future software development for a collaborative authoring interface

## üîÄ System Zones (Conceptual Layer)

### 1. Soft System
- Journaling
- Brainstorms
- Loose strategy planning
- Conversational work-in-progress
- Exploratory research

### 2. Hard System
- Locked floatprompts
- UID-based linking
- Structured dependencies
- Execution chains
- Software-ingestable protocol

### 3. Edge Layer
- Links soft ‚Üí hard
- Extract staging zones
- Chain-aware versioning
- Risk-controlled ideation

## üîß Extraction Strategy

Every prompt created from this map should follow:
- Declare UID lineage
- Link back to this map
- Encode purpose and relationship type
- Use `planned_prompts` to preview full ecosystem intent

## üß¨ Prompt Family (Declared Spec Lineage)

| ID                                 | Type            | Purpose                                          |
|------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `floatprompt-vnext-spec.fp`        | specification    | New floatprompt protocol spec (v0.12+)           |
| `floatprompt-os-software-vision.fp`| specification    | Software product concept and interface plan      |
| `floatprompt-duality-philosophy.fp`| philosophy       | Deep dive on soft vs hard prompt cognition model |
| `project-logbook.fp`               | journal          | Capture software build progress and prompts      |

## ü™ú Strategic Ladder

1. **Map** (this prompt)
2. **Extract** (from here to children)
3. **Structure** (specs, product, philosophy)
4. **Build** (software, protocol vNext)

## üß† Core Strategic Insight

The most powerful systems preserve ambiguity where needed, and precision where required.

A FloatPrompt OS must:
- Distinguish soft vs hard reasoning threads
- Allow transitory work without polluting logic
- Guide AI with structured confidence without stifling creativity

## üìç Anchor Principle

**‚ÄúPreserve the map. Extract with intention.‚Äù**

This map governs the prompt graph, like a constitutional document. It is not meant to be executed. It is meant to guide execution, control scope, and contain the future.
