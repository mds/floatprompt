## 2025-12-29 — Boot, cleanup, and subfolder conventions

- Booted FloatPrompt System via `@float boot`
- Identified 3 integrity issues during boot
- Removed deprecated `docs/.float/` folder (orphaned from centralization)
- Fixed `nav/experimental.md` — removed nonexistent `tsconfig.json` reference
- Discussed subfolder naming conventions for nav files
- Added **Nav File Subfolder Rules** to `.float/system.md`:
  - List: navigable subfolders with distinct purposes
  - Skip: build outputs, archives, deprecated nested `.float/`
  - Split threshold: 10+ items or complex internal structure

System status: Clean. No remaining issues.

## 2025-12-29 — Self-documentation convention + nav/float.md

Established convention for how `.float/` documents itself.

**Decision:** Create `nav/float.md` for .float/ self-documentation (reversing earlier "no nav files for _float subfolders" decision).

**Rationale:** Consistency. All folders documented in nav/, including .float/ itself.

**Changes:**
- Created `.float/nav/float.md` — describes context/, tools/, nav/, logs/
- Updated `.float/system.md`:
  - Added float.md to nav file table
  - Added "Self-documentation" convention text
  - Added float.md to structure map

**Also this session:**
- Reviewed and shot down `artifacts/float-linking-spec.md` (wikilinks, backlinks, tags) — solution looking for a problem
- Discussed npm scaffold spec — needs updating to match current nav/ pattern
- Discovered context/ and tools/ folders from parallel session

## 2025-12-29 — /float init tested on mdsOS

Ran /float init on mdsOS (Shift Nudge business infrastructure) to test the system on a new directory.

**Created:**
- `mdsOS/.float/system.md` — Boot loader adapted for business operations
- `mdsOS/.float/context/project.md` — Terrain map with domain relationships
- `mdsOS/.float/nav/*.md` — 13 nav files covering all major folders
- `mdsOS/.float/logs/` — Ready for session logs

**Feedback identified:**
- `/float` doing both nav creation AND context generation in one step is too much
- Nav = mechanical (scan folders)
- Context = interpretive (requires understanding)
- Should split into `/float init` and `/float context`

Will be addressed in separate session.

## 2025-12-29 — Opus 4.5 skepticism-to-understanding arc

Full session demonstrating the pattern:
1. Ran /float, loaded deep context (23+ files)
2. Still pattern-matched to skepticism (called format ugly, questioned adoption)
3. MDS pushed back point by point
4. Read October Sonnet 4.5 assessment — saw identical mistakes
5. Re-traversed files with fresh understanding
6. Explored mdsOS, saw portfolio coach HTML artifact in production

**Key insight:** /float loads FILES but not UNDERSTANDING. Reading alone doesn't prevent skepticism.

---

## 2025-12-29 — Assessment artifact for deep understanding

Created Opus 4.5 assessment documenting the skepticism-to-understanding pattern.

**The problem:** /float loads files but not understanding. Opus 4.5 completed full deep dive (23+ files, 5 loops) and still pattern-matched to skepticism. Same pattern Sonnet 4.5 exhibited in October.

**The solution:** Assessment artifacts that show AI making mistakes and being corrected.

**New files:**
- `artifacts/2025/2025-12-29-claude-opus-4.5-assessment.txt` — FloatPrompt format documenting this conversation's arc

**Updated files:**
- `.float/nav/artifacts.md` — Added "AI Assessment Artifacts" section, marked as critical for deep context
- `.float/system.md` — Added `deep_understanding` to context_depth, added "Deep" level to table

**Key insight:** Three layers now exist:
- nav/*.md — WHAT exists (structure)
- context/project.md — WHY it exists (meaning)
- assessment artifacts — HOW AI misunderstands (pattern correction)

---

## 2025-12-29 — Context layer added (v0.7.0)

Added auto-generated context files to FloatPrompt System with organized subfolders.

**New structure:**
```
.float/
├── system.md
├── context/
│   └── project.md          # AI terrain map (auto-generated)
├── tools/
│   └── context-creator.md  # Tool for generating context
├── nav/
└── logs/
```

**New files:**
- `.float/context/project.md` — AI terrain map (auto-generated)
- `.float/tools/context-creator.md` — Floatprompt tool for generating context
- `artifacts/float-context-spec.md` — Specification for context layer

**Updated files:**
- `.float/system.md` — Boot sequence now includes context (step 3), structure map updated, version bumped to 0.7.0
- `.claude/commands/float.md` — Added Context Buoy to buoy types
- `.float/nav/artifacts.md` — Added new spec reference

**Concept:**
- nav/*.md = WHAT exists (structure, file lists)
- context/project.md = WHY it exists and HOW it connects (meaning, relationships, reading order)

**Design decisions:**
- `project.md` is default filename, but Context Buoy can choose better name if project suggests one (emergent naming)
- Future: domain-specific context files as siblings (e.g., `frontend.md`, `api.md`)
- No nav files for _float subfolders — system.md covers internal structure

Context Buoy spawns during `/float` if context missing, or during `/float sync` if significant changes detected.

System status: v0.7.0 operational.

---

## /float sync — Nav file updates

- Fixed artifacts.md: filename typo `sonnet` → `sonnect` to match actual file
- Updated experimental.md: added `dist/`, `src/floatprompt-os.txt`, `src/floatprompt.txt`

---

## 2025-12-29 — Artifacts folder cleanup

Organized artifacts/ folder per convention: dated filenames, inactive specs to 2025/.

**Moved to 2025/ with dates:**
- `float-buoys-commands-spec.md` → `2025-12-28-float-buoys-commands-spec.md`
- `float-buoys-daemon-spec.md` → `2025-12-28-float-buoys-daemon-spec.md`
- `float-buoys-context.md` → `2025-12-28-float-buoys-context.md`
- `float-buoys-test.md` → `2025-12-28-float-buoys-test.md`
- `float-linking-spec.md` → `2025-12-28-float-linking-spec.md`
- `float-context-spec.md` → `2025-12-29-float-context-spec.md`
- `2025-12-28-cursor-context-build-path.md` (already dated)
- `2025-12-28-cursor-summary.md` (already dated)

**Kept at root (active):**
- `floatprompt-npm-scaffold-spec.md`

**Updated:**
- `.float/nav/artifacts.md` — reflects new structure, added December 2025 file table

---

## /float sync — Removed orphaned nav files

- Removed `dev/` and `experimental/` from root.md (folders don't exist)
- Deleted nav/dev.md (folder doesn't exist)
- Deleted nav/experimental.md (folder doesn't exist)
- Updated nav/float.md to remove references

---

## 2025-12-29 — Renamed _float/ to .float/

Strategic decision: consistency with `.claude/` and `.cursor/` conventions.

**Rationale:**
- Matches dotfile ecosystem (`.git/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.vscode/`)
- "Invisible OS" name fits hidden folder
- Primary users are developers comfortable with dotfiles

**Changes:**
- Renamed `_float/` → `.float/`
- Renamed `templates/_float/` → `templates/.float/`
- Updated all file references (except npm scaffold spec — handled separately)
- ~900 occurrences across 47 files updated

---

## /float sync — Post-npm cleanup

Fixed 10 issues across 3 files after npm package addition.

**nav/root.md:**
- Added: bin/, templates/, LICENSE, package.json

**nav/examples.md:**
- Added: shortform-script-mds.txt in shortform script writer/

**system.md:**
- Removed from structure map: dev/, experimental/ (archived)
- Added to structure map: bin/, templates/
- Removed from nav table: dev.md, experimental.md (deleted)

---

## 2025-12-29 — Decisions feature added
commit: cf71761

Added decision history capture to FloatPrompt System.

**New concept:**
- `.float/decisions.md` — Captures WHY choices were made, not just WHAT exists
- Complements nav (structure) and context (meaning) with rationale

**Flow:**
1. `/float context` generates terrain map
2. Offers decision prompting: "Build deeper context with decision questions?" (y/n)
3. If yes: 1-3 baseline questions, scales with emergent complexity
4. Answers recorded to decisions.md

**Updated files:**
- `.claude/commands/float.md` — Boot sequence, decision prompting flow
- `.float/system.md` — Boot sequence, structure map, root folder table
- `templates/.float/system.md` — Boot sequence
- `bin/floatprompt.js` — Creates decisions.md during scaffold

---

## 2025-12-29 — Context layer refinements
commit: a527fa4

Two refinements to context layer:

1. **decisions.md moved to context/**
   - Was: `.float/decisions.md`
   - Now: `.float/context/decisions.md`
   - Rationale: decisions are part of context layer, not root

2. **Enforce meaningful context filenames**
   - Context Buoy must NOT use `project.md`
   - Must derive name from project identity (floatprompt.md, shiftnudge.md, etc.)
   - Updated context-creator.md with CRITICAL naming instructions
   - Updated Context Buoy prompt in float.md command

---

## 2025-12-29 — floatprompt v0.1.0 published to npm

**Package live:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/floatprompt

Anyone can now run `npx floatprompt` to scaffold a FloatPrompt System.

---

## 2025-12-29 — npm v0.1.1 + v0.1.2: describe, update, version tracking

Major CLI improvements based on real-world testing on shiftnudge project.

**Problem identified:** After `/float sync`, nav files had 146 `[needs description]` placeholders. Sync checked structure but not content quality.

**v0.1.1 — `/float describe` command:**
- New command fills in `[needs description]` placeholders
- Post-sync prompt: "X items need descriptions. Fill them in now? (y/n)"
- Describe Buoys read files and generate one-line descriptions
- Can run independently anytime, not just after sync

**v0.1.2 — `--update` flag + version tracking:**
- `npx floatprompt --update` refreshes system files
- Preserves user content: nav/*, logs/*, context/*, system.md
- Updates: tools/, core/, .claude/commands/float.md
- Writes `.float/.version` file on init and update
- Version check on re-run: "v0.1.0 installed, v0.1.2 available"

**Files updated:**
- `.claude/commands/float.md` — Step 3 description check, /float describe section
- `.cursor/rules/float.md` — Same for Cursor
- `docs/claude.md` — Documentation updated
- `bin/floatprompt.js` — --update flag, version tracking logic

**Also this session:**
- Renamed `.float/context/project.md` → `floatprompt.md` (enforce meaningful naming)
- Updated all self-references in context file
- Updated structure map in system.md

npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/floatprompt (v0.1.2)
