# No Code Without Requirements

**Date:** 2026-01-02

## Decision

**Map → Decide → Structure is a GATE, not a suggestion.**

Before writing ANY code, AI must be able to answer:

> "Can I write a complete spec for this code without any gaps?"

If NO → don't write code yet. Go back to Map or Decide.

## Future Agent

| Work Type | Agent |
|-----------|-------|
| Enforce methodology | `orchestrator` — should gate code generation |
| Validate requirements | `requirement_validator` — check for gaps before Structure phase |

**Do not revisit. This is a permanent rule.**
