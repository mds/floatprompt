# Phase 2 Planning Complete

**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Status:** Locked

---

## Decision

Phase 2 planning is complete. All 16 questions answered, stress tested, ready to implement.

**Phase 2 = Build importer to test SQLite schema with wip-logs data.**

---

## Rationale

Map → Decide → Structure is a GATE. Phase 2 required locked requirements before implementation. This session completed the Decide phase.

---

**Next:** Build importer (`src/db/client.ts`, `src/db/import.ts`)
