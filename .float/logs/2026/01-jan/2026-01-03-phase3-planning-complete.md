## Decision

Phase 3 (Scanner) planning is complete. All 15 questions answered, 11 locked decisions, 4 working theories. Ready to build `src/db/scan.ts`.

---

## Rationale

Following the "No Code Without Requirements" methodology (Map → Decide → Structure), we planned the scanner before building it. The planning document (`wip-phase3.md`) captures:

- The problem we're solving (context loss)
- Where scanner fits in the 3-layer architecture
- Autonomous scopes concept
- All 15 implementation questions answered
- The infinite scalability vision
