# Archive Unity Decision

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Status:** Locked

---

## Decision

ONE archive with Series inside, not separate archival systems.

---

## Rationale

**Archival science principle:** A Collection has Series, not sibling Collections.

**Practical:** One mental model, one pattern, one place to look.

---

**Do not revisit.**
