# Handoff

**Session 59** → **Session 60**

## Where We Are
FloatPrompt context infrastructure is functional with 4-stage capture pipeline working end-to-end. Capture workflow validates that float-capture.sh → float-log → float-enrich → float-handoff cycle is properly integrated. Log entries create successfully with title/decision/rationale auto-populated from float-log agent responses.

## What Just Happened
- Added verification comment to float-capture.sh documenting the 4-stage pipeline
- Tested complete capture workflow: triggered session capture, verified log entry ID 31 was created with proper metadata
- Confirmed handoff.md generation working (this file was generated by float-handoff agent)
- Validated that float-log agent correctly updates log_entries table with structured decision/rationale from transcript analysis

## What Matters
Session continuity infrastructure is proven. The plumbing works. Next priority is validating distribution pathway (Phase 6: marketplace.json) and ensuring the 5-minute dedup window is sufficient for real-world agent execution timing.

## Watch Out For
- Agent spawning in float-capture.sh requires careful YAML frontmatter handling (ensure prompt text isn't malformed)
- Transcript file sizes can exceed 256KB — use tail/head or grep for large transcripts rather than full reads
- float.db queries work reliably with sqlite3 CLI — use this for log entry validation in future sessions

## Unfinished
- Phase 6 marketplace.json distribution not yet validated
- Agent execution timing analysis not done — need to verify 5-minute dedup window is adequate
- Organic session capture testing (this was a manual test, not a real development session)

## Next Move
1. Test marketplace.json distribution pathway to ensure Phase 6 works correctly
2. Profile actual agent execution timing across multiple runs to validate dedup window adequacy
3. Trigger capture workflow in an actual development session to test organic behavior
4. Consider documenting float-capture.sh trigger points for clarity
