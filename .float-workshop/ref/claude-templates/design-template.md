# [Project Name] — Design

> Aesthetic principles, not pixel specs. Give AI judgment to work from, not just rules to follow.

---

## Aesthetic Direction

[Describe the feeling. What should this look like? Use adjectives and references, not hex codes.]

- [e.g., Clean, minimal, Swiss-inspired]
- [e.g., Generous whitespace, breathing room]
- [e.g., Content-forward, nothing decorative]
- [e.g., Feels fast, no heavy elements]

**Reference points:** [Optional: name 1-3 sites/apps that capture the feeling]

---

## Typography

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Font family | [e.g., System fonts only, no custom typefaces] |
| Hierarchy | [e.g., Size + weight, not color. Two levels max.] |
| Body text | [e.g., Readable, not tiny. 16px minimum.] |
| Headings | [e.g., Bold, not huge. Let whitespace create hierarchy.] |

**Philosophy:** [e.g., "Typography should be invisible. If you notice the font, it's wrong."]

---

## Color

| Role | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Background | [e.g., White or near-white. No dark mode for v1.] |
| Text | [e.g., Near-black, not pure black. Easy on eyes.] |
| Accent | [e.g., One accent color for interactive elements.] |
| Feedback | [e.g., Green for success, red for error. Standard conventions.] |

**Philosophy:** [e.g., "Muted palette, low contrast. Color is information, not decoration."]

**Avoid:** [e.g., Gradients, shadows, multiple accent colors]

---

## Spacing

| Context | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Between sections | [e.g., Generous. Let content breathe.] |
| Within components | [e.g., Tight. Group related elements.] |
| Page margins | [e.g., Consistent, responsive. Not cramped on mobile.] |

**Philosophy:** [e.g., "When in doubt, add more whitespace."]

---

## Components

### Buttons

[e.g., Simple rectangles. No rounded corners. Clear hover state.]

### Inputs

[e.g., Clean borders, no shadows. Focus state is obvious.]

### Cards

[e.g., Subtle borders if needed. No drop shadows. Flat.]

### Navigation

[e.g., Minimal. Text links, not icon buttons. Breadcrumbs for depth.]

---

## Interactions

| Type | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Hover states | [e.g., Subtle. Underline or slight color shift.] |
| Transitions | [e.g., Fast (150-200ms). No bouncy animations.] |
| Loading | [e.g., Simple spinner or skeleton. No elaborate animations.] |
| Feedback | [e.g., Immediate. User knows something happened.] |

**Philosophy:** [e.g., "Snappy, not playful. Respect the user's time."]

---

## Anti-Patterns

Things this design should **never** have:

- [e.g., Drop shadows]
- [e.g., Gradients]
- [e.g., Rounded corners everywhere]
- [e.g., Icons without labels]
- [e.g., Hamburger menus on desktop]
- [e.g., Auto-playing anything]
- [e.g., Dark patterns]

---

## Inspiration

| Reference | What to take from it |
|-----------|---------------------|
| [Site/app name] | [Specific element: "their use of whitespace"] |
| [Site/app name] | [Specific element: "typography hierarchy"] |

---

## Responsive Approach

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| Mobile | [e.g., Single column, stacked layout] |
| Tablet | [e.g., Same as mobile, slightly more breathing room] |
| Desktop | [e.g., Centered content, max-width container] |

**Philosophy:** [e.g., "Mobile-first. Desktop gets more whitespace, not more features."]

---

## Accessibility (Minimum Bar)

- [ ] Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Focusable elements have visible focus states
- [ ] Text is resizable without breaking layout
- [ ] Interactive elements are large enough to tap (44px minimum)
