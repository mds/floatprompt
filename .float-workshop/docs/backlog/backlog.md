# Backlog

**Purpose:** "Not now" — parked work. May revisit later.

**Updated by:** `protocols/update-files.md`

---

## Parked

| Doc | Status | Why Parked |
|-----|--------|------------|
| [wip-float-build-spec.md](wip-float-build-spec.md) | Tabled | Plugin-first approach faster |
| [vercel-sdk-integration-spec.md](vercel-sdk-integration-spec.md) | Tabled | Plugin-first approach faster |
| [float-CMS-context-management-system.md](float-CMS-context-management-system.md) | Superseded | Plugin model replaces this |
| [workshop.md](workshop.md) | Parked | Original workshop notes |
| [workshop-reorg-plan.md](workshop-reorg-plan.md) | Active | Current reorg plan (delete when done) |

---

## Blocked

Items that can't move forward due to dependencies.

| Doc | Blocked By | Unblocks When |
|-----|------------|---------------|
| [wip-layer-3-ongoing.md](wip-layer-3-ongoing.md) | Plugin architecture | Agent patterns validated |
