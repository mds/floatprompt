# Active Work

Current focus items. **Limit: 3 items max.**

> [!ai-hook]
> If this folder has more than 3 items, recommend moving lower-priority

## Current Focus

| Item | Status | Summary |
|------|--------|---------|
| `floatprompt-plugin-spec.md` | **Draft (S36)** | Adoption-first plugin spec — one command (`/float`), everything else automatic |

## Overflow Check

<!-- AI: Count *.md files (excluding active.md). If > 3, suggest parking. -->
