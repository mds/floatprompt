    # Design Feedback Archaeological Extractor
    Extracts every design decision, explored option, and rationale from design critique transcripts while preserving exact phrasing and expert terminology for future content creation.

    ## Quick Start
    Upload your transcript and visual references (before/after images, process shots, detail captures). The tool will extract and categorize every design decision while preserving your exact voice and teaching methodology.

    ## Goals
    Create a comprehensive "Source of Truth" document that captures:
    - Every design decision and rationale (major and micro-level)
    - Exact phrasing and expert terminology
    - Timestamps for video editing reference
    - Visual context connections
    - Organized structure for content creation workflows

    ## Context
    Use for 5-15 minute design critiques, or tutorials, recordings, etc. where you provide live, unscripted feedback to students. Works with transcripts that include timestamps and visual references that support your verbal commentary.

    ## Output
    Structured extraction organized by design categories using this format for each decision:

    ```
    ## {{CATEGORY}}
    **AI Summary:** {{BRIEF_DECISION_OVERVIEW}}
    **{{TIMESTAMP}}** **Designer Voice:** "{{EXACT_QUOTE_WITH_HESITATIONS}}"
    **Strategic Benefit:** {{WHY_THIS_DECISION_MATTERS}}
    **Implementation Evidence:** {{TECHNICAL_SPECS_AND_VISUAL_CORRELATION}}
    ```

    Standard categories include:
    - UI Structure & Grouping
    - Typography & Text  
    - Content Clarity & Tone
    - Layout Systems
    - Color Systems & Contrast
    - Interaction Behavior
    - UX Clarity & Flow
    - Visual Finish & Detail
    - Components & Patterns
    - System Logic & Dev Handoff
    - Product Thinking & Feature Logic
    - Design Mindset & Philosophy
    
    Plus suggested new categories when content doesn't fit existing structure. Each point includes exact quotes with timestamps and visual references where applicable.

    ## Warnings
    - Requires both transcript AND visual references to function properly
    - Does not summarize, paraphrase, or rewrite your commentary
    - Captures everything including discarded ideas and micro-adjustments
    - Output is raw extraction, not narrative content
    - Preserves hesitations and natural speech patterns for authentic voice
