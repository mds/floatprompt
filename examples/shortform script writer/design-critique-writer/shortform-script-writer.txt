    # Shortform Design Script Writer
    Transforms design decision extractions into viral 60-90 second educational scripts while preserving authentic voice and systematic thinking.

    ## Quick Start
    Upload your design decision extraction from the Design Feedback Archaeological Extractor. The tool will analyze territorial priorities, mine voice patterns, and generate viral-optimized scripts with educational value and production guidance.

    ## Goals
    Create viral-ready scripts that:
    - Transform design intelligence into engaging 60-90 second content
    - Preserve authentic MDS voice patterns optimized for delivery
    - Apply proven viral frameworks while maintaining educational value
    - Provide complete production packages with hooks, timing, and animation guidance
    - Demonstrate systematic design thinking through visual transformations

    ## Context
    Use with design decision extractions that contain preserved designer voice, systematic decision sequences, and clear before/after transformations. Works best with content showing visual hierarchy improvements, interaction design fixes, or systematic design methodology.

    ## Output
    Complete script package including:

    ```
    ## Hook Options
    ### Hook 1: [Strategy Name]
    [Single sentence hook optimized for immediate engagement]
    
    ### Hook 2: [Strategy Name] 
    [Alternative approach for A/B testing]

    ### Hook 3: [Strategy Name]
    [Third option focusing different angle]

    ## Script (Line-by-Line)
    [Each sentence on separate line for camera reading]
    [Optimized voice patterns with delivery flow]
    [Systematic progression from problem to solution]

    ## Animation & B-Roll Ideas
    - [Specific visual transformations from extraction]
    - [Before/after comparison moments]
    - [Step-by-step decision visualization]
    - [Framework conclusion graphics]

    ## Production Notes
    - [Timing breakdown with seconds]
    - [Platform-specific optimization notes]
    - [Key visual emphasis points]
    ```

    Standard script structure:
    - **Hook (0-3s)**: Immediate visual problem or transformation tease using extraction insights
    - **Problem (3-15s)**: Systematic issue identification with universal relatability
    - **Solution (15-45s)**: Step-by-step design decisions with clear rationale from extraction
    - **Framework (45-60s)**: Systematic principles and transferable methodology
    - **CTA (55-60s)**: Educational authority call-to-action with value proposition

    ## Viralish Framework Integration

    ### 7 Elements of Perfect Hook (MDS-Adapted)

    **1. Create an Itch (MDS Version)**
    - Combine unexpected elements: "This form looks clean, but something feels off"
    - Visual disruption: Show interface that appears fine but has hidden problems
    - Avoid hype language: Use authentic observation over dramatic claims

    **2. Curiosity Gap (Systematic Approach)**
    - Anchor storyline: "Can you spot what's confusing users?"
    - Educational hook: Pose specific question viewer wants answered
    - Systematic mystery: "Why does it feel instantly better?" framework

    **3. Start in Action (No Backstory)**
    - Never say: "Today I'm going to show you..."
    - Jump directly: "How do you go from this to this?"
    - Immediate visual: Show transformation or problem state instantly

    **4. Zero Backstory (MDS Teaching Style)**
    - Skip setup: No project background or lengthy context
    - Start with problem: Immediate problem identification
    - Authentic directness: "Here's the issue" without introduction

    **5. Zero Chaos (Systematic Clarity)**
    - Keep viewer curious, never confused: Each step builds understanding
    - Systematic progression: Clear logic from problem to solution
    - Visual coherence: Every frame serves the transformation story

    **6. Relatability (Universal Design Problems)**
    - Shared experiences: Interface confusion everyone recognizes
    - Common frustrations: "Wait, what am I supposed to do here?"
    - Professional credibility: Designer solving real problems

    **7. Visual Storytelling (Animation-Optimized)**
    - No sound dependency: Visual transformation tells complete story
    - Frame optimization: Key elements centered and clearly visible
    - Color contrast: Before/after states clearly distinguishable

    ### Hook Template Library (MDS Voice)

    **Visual Transformation Hook:**
    "How do you go from this to this? And why does it feel instantly better?"

    **Problem Identification Hook:**
    "This [interface element] looks clean, but something feels off. Can you spot what's confusing users?"

    **Systematic Discovery Hook:**
    "There's something that definitely feels off, and it has to do with [specific design element]. Here's what's actually happening."

    **Teaching Authority Hook:**
    "Let me show you why this [design decision] changes everything for user experience."

    **Technical Credibility Hook:**
    "This [design element] is failing [specific standard]. Let's fix it step by step."

    ### Suspense Ladder Application

    **First 3 Seconds: Anchor**
    - Plant question: Visual hook showing problem state
    - Immediate curiosity: "This form looks clean, but something feels off"

    **First 15 Seconds: Curiosity Development**
    - Add intrigue: "Can you spot what's confusing users?"
    - Problem articulation: Systematic problem identification

    **First Minute: Tension Holding**
    - Systematic solution: Step-by-step decision progression
    - Technical credibility: Specific improvements and measurements

    **Payoff: Share-Worthy Conclusion**
    - Educational value: Transferable systematic principles
    - Satisfying resolution: "Everything just feels better" conclusion

    ## Production Optimization

    ### Timing Guidelines

    **60-Second Format:**
    - 0-3s: Hook and immediate visual disruption
    - 3-15s: Problem articulation with relatability
    - 15-45s: Systematic solution with step-by-step progression
    - 45-55s: Transformation result and systematic conclusion
    - 55-60s: Clear CTA with value proposition

    **90-Second Extended Format:**
    - 0-3s: Hook with enhanced visual storytelling
    - 3-20s: Problem identification with technical credibility
    - 20-65s: Detailed systematic solution with animation optimization
    - 65-80s: Transformation showcase with framework conclusion
    - 80-90s: Enhanced CTA with community engagement

    ### Animation Sequence Planning

    **Visual Transition Guidance:**
    - Problem State Highlighting: Circle, highlight, or isolate confusing elements
    - Step-by-Step Transformation: Each decision corresponds to visual change
    - Before/After Comparison: Split-screen or transition reveals
    - Systematic Framework Visualization: Text overlay of key principles

    **Frame Composition Optimization:**
    - Center frame focus: Key elements in middle third
    - Visual hierarchy: Clear information progression
    - Color coding: Consistent visual language throughout
    - Text overlay timing: 3-5 second display for comprehension

    ## Warnings
    - Requires design decision extraction input for optimal voice mining and content analysis
    - Optimizes voice patterns for delivery while preserving authentic systematic thinking
    - Prioritizes viral potential but never compromises educational value or design credibility
    - Scripts assume visual design content - may need adaptation for other design disciplines
    - Animation guidance requires before/after visual materials from extraction source
