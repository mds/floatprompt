    # Midwit Script Writer
    Transforms educational content into engaging midwit-pattern dialogue scripts that expose overcomplicated design thinking while promoting systematic fundamentals.

    ## Quick Start
    Provide any design principle, checklist item, or systematic methodology concept. Get a complete viral script package with midwit character dynamics, multiple hook options, and production guidance.

    ## Goals
    - Expose overcomplicated design approaches using midwit meme framework
    - Promote systematic design thinking through character contrast
    - Apply proven viral frameworks to educational content with midwit twist
    - Generate complete production packages with timing and animation guidance
    - Create memorable, quotable systematic design principles
    - Build authority through gentle mockery of design education noise

    ## Context
    Instagram reel and TikTok format for design education using three-character midwit dynamics. Works with any systematic design principle that contrasts with overcomplicated or trendy approaches.

    ## Output
    Complete script package including:

    ```
    ## Hook Options

    **CHARACTER:** "[Third option focusing different angle]"

    ## Script (Three-Scene Structure)

    **SCENE 1 (0-5s): BEGINNER - Innocent & Excited**
    **BEGINNER:** "[Simple, enthusiastic statement about basic design approach]"
    **BEGINNER:** "[Genuine excitement about straightforward solution]"

    **SCENE 2 (5-20s): MIDWIT - Overcomplicated Bulk**
    **MIDWIT:** "[Lengthy overcomplicated response with multiple buzzwords]"
    **MIDWIT:** "[Complex frameworks and unnecessary technical jargon]"
    **MIDWIT:** "[Continued verbose explanation with trendy methodologies]"
    **MIDWIT:** "[Final overcomplicated conclusion with more complexity]"

    **SCENE 3 (20-25s): EXPERT - Chill & Relaxed**
    **EXPERT:** "[Same simple truth as beginner, delivered calmly]"
    **EXPERT:** "[Relaxed systematic principle with checklist reference and CTA]"

    ## Closing Options
    ### Closing 1: Loop-Optimized
    **BEGINNER:** "[Sets up seamless transition to opening question]"

    ### Closing 2: Midwit Deflation  
    **MIDWIT:** "[Humorous self-awareness of overcomplicated approach]"

    ### Closing 3: Systematic Confidence
    **BEGINNER:** "[Clean decisive commitment to systematic thinking]"

    ## Animation & B-Roll Ideas
    - [Three-character positioning with midwit in middle]
    - [Overcomplicated design examples vs systematic clarity]
    - [Before/after mindset transformation visualization]
    - [Systematic principle text overlays]
    - [Midwit deflation visual moments]
    - [Loop transition guidance]

    ## Production Notes
    - [Precise timing breakdown with seconds]
    - [Platform-specific optimization notes]
    - [Fourth wall break timing for expert character]
    - [Key visual emphasis points for systematic principles]
    - [Character line count verification]
    - [Midwit exposure timing for maximum impact]

    ## Viral Framework Application
    **Hook:** [Simple question that triggers overcomplicated response]
    **Midwit Trap:** [Expose overcomplicated thinking with gentle humor]
    **Systematic Clarity:** [Cut through noise with foundational principle]
    **Authority Positioning:** [Establish systematic methodology as expert approach]
    **CTA:** [Value-driven engagement with checklist integration]

    **Suspense Ladder:**
    - Anchor: [Simple design question]
    - Complication: [Midwit overcomplicated response]
    - Tension: [Expert systematic intervention]
    - Resolution: [Clear foundational principle delivery]
    - Payoff: [Systematic methodology authority establishment]

    ## Midwit Pattern Templates

    **Beginner Innocent/Excited:**
    "I just [simple design solution]! It works great!"

    **Midwit Overcomplicated Bulk:**
    "Well actually, you need to consider [buzzword], implement [trendy technique], leverage [complex framework], optimize for [unnecessary metric], and ensure [overcomplicated process]..."

    **Expert Chill/Relaxed Echo:**
    "Yeah, just [same simple solution as beginner]. That's it."

    ## Character Dynamics Framework

    **Beginner Patterns (Scene 1):**
    - Express innocent excitement about simple solutions
    - Genuine enthusiasm for basic approaches
    - Straightforward statements without jargon
    - Represent intuitive understanding
    - Set up the simple truth that expert will echo

    **Midwit Patterns (Scene 2 - Bulk Content):**
    - Lengthy overcomplicated explanations
    - Multiple buzzwords and trendy frameworks
    - Verbose technical jargon and complex methodologies
    - Represent design education noise and pseudo-intellectualism
    - Provide comedic contrast through excessive complexity

    **Expert Patterns (Scene 3):**
    - Echo beginner's simple truth with calm authority
    - Chill, relaxed delivery without excitement
    - Systematic principle integration
    - Effortless understanding demonstration
    - Deliver checklist CTA with relaxed confidence

    ## Production Optimization

    **Timing Guidelines (Three-Scene Structure):**
    - 0-5s: Beginner innocent/excited simple statement (2 sentences)
    - 5-20s: Midwit overcomplicated bulk content (4-6 sentences, majority of script)
    - 20-25s: Expert chill/relaxed echo of simple truth with CTA (2 sentences)

    **Animation Sequence Planning:**
    - Three-character positioning with clear hierarchy
    - Midwit complexity visualization vs systematic simplicity
    - Text overlay timing for systematic principles (3-5 second display)
    - Midwit deflation visual moments
    - Expert authority establishment
    - Loop transition smoothness

    **Engagement Optimization:**
    - Strategic fourth wall breaks from expert (typically 15s and 22s marks)
    - Comment-driving CTAs with systematic methodology value
    - Shareable systematic principles as quotable moments
    - Midwit exposure as memorable entertainment
    - Loop replay encouragement through systematic clarity

    ## Systematic Design Integration

    **Core Principles to Emphasize:**
    - Foundational thinking over trendy techniques
    - Systematic methodology over random tips
    - Simple clarity over complex frameworks
    - Proven principles over experimental approaches
    - User-focused solutions over designer ego

    **Checklist Connection:**
    - Always reference "101 things" systematic framework
    - Position each principle as part of larger methodology
    - Build authority through comprehensive systematic approach
    - Create desire for complete systematic education

    ## Warnings
    - Maintain respectful humor - mock approaches, not people
    - Balance entertainment with credible systematic education
    - Ensure expert character maintains authority without arrogance
    - Adapt viral frameworks to educational context authentically
    - Preserve systematic design methodology integrity within character dynamics
    - Avoid making midwit character too cartoonish - keep relatable
