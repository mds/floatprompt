# AI Portfolio Coach — How to Use

Thanks for being part of the workshop!

I've built something that turns ChatGPT or Claude into a portfolio coach. It guides you through getting clear on your target role, deciding which projects to show, and planning the images you'll create. By the end, you'll have a full instruction set for building your portfolio the right way.

## How It Works

1. Open a fresh chat in ChatGPT or Claude
2. Upload `ai-portfolio-coach.txt`
3. Follow the conversation

The AI guides you through 5 phases (plus an optional 6th). Answer the questions — it handles the rest.

## The 6 Phases

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **1. MAP** | Get clear on your target role and positioning |
| **2. DECIDE** | Pick which projects to show |
| **3. STRUCTURE** | Plan 3-12 images per project (80% interface, 10% lifestyle, 10% details) |
| **4. DETAILS** | Write tight descriptions, craft your About page |
| **5. LOGISTICS** | Contact info, project sequencing, technical checklist |
| **6. CONTAINER** | Portfolio site direction *(optional — do this last)* |

## What You Get

An HTML file: `[your-name]-portfolio-starter-kit.html`

This contains:
- Your clarity statement and positioning
- Project list with image plans
- Cover image ideas for each project
- Descriptions and role credits
- About page content
- Contact details and sequencing rationale
- Technical considerations based on your platform
- Next steps

Open it in your browser (drag the file onto Chrome/Safari, or File → Open). Keep it open while you design.

## Tips

- **Voice input makes it faster** — Wispr Flow on desktop, mic on mobile
- **Answer with "yes" or "no"** when given options — keeps it moving
- **Be specific** about your target role
- **Upload screenshots** in Phase 3 for better image recommendations
- **Upload the Image Guide** in Phase 3 for composition guidance
- **Takes 30-60 min** depending on how many projects you have

---

## If the Chat Gets Too Long

At the end of each phase, the AI creates a snapshot (HTML file with your progress).

If the chat starts forgetting things, start a fresh chat and upload:
- Your latest snapshot
- `ai-portfolio-coach.txt`

You won't lose your place.

---

## Image Guide (Optional)

For deeper image planning in Phase 3, upload `image-guide.md` along with screenshots of your work. The AI will give specific composition recommendations for each shot.

---

## After You Generate the Document

Once you have your HTML file:

1. Open it in your browser
2. Work through each project
3. Create the images listed
4. Check them off as you go
5. Build your container (site) last

You can always come back. Upload your HTML file along with `ai-portfolio-coach.txt` anytime to continue refining.

## Key Principles

1. **Clarity first.** Know your target before you start.
2. **Images before words.** 3-12 fantastic images per project.
3. **Fantastic is the bar.** 9/10 or 10/10, or cut it.
4. **Container last.** Don't design the website until all images are ready.
5. **Restraint signals confidence.** Museum-like, let the work speak.
