# Portfolio Image Guide

## Composition Principles for Portfolio Images

**Foundational**
- **Rule of Thirds** — Place key elements off-center, along grid lines
- **Centered & Symmetrical** — Works when the subject is symmetrical (straight-on device shots, app icons)
- **Foreground/Depth** — Layer elements to create dimensionality (useful for environmental/lifestyle shots)
- **Frame Within Frame** — Device bezels, browser chrome, hands holding phones can add context

**Dynamic**
- **Leading Lines** — Let UI hierarchy guide the eye through the image
- **Patterns** — Show systematic thinking (icon families, component states, consistent elements)
- **Break the Pattern** — Highlight the one thing that stands out (when you want to draw attention to a specific element)

**Arrangement**
- **Fill the Frame** — Crop tight, no wasted space (particularly effective for detail shots and close-ups)
- **Negative Space** — Generous breathing room, museum-like presentation (lets strong work speak for itself)
- **Simplicity** — One screen, clean background, no distractions (when the screen alone is the story)

**Point of View**
- **Straight-On** — Default. Most images. No gimmicks. Craft shows here.
- **Angled/Environmental** — Sparingly. Only when it genuinely adds.

**Context**
- **Juxtaposition** — Before/after, mobile/desktop, problem/solution (when contrast tells the story)
- **Human Element** — Hands, use context, environment (adds warmth and scale when appropriate)
- **Decisive Moment** — Show the UI at its most impactful state

**The contradiction principle** — Many of these oppose each other (fill the frame vs. negative space, simplicity vs. patterns). Neither is "better." Choose based on what the specific image needs.

## UI Image Types

**Hero Shots**
- Full-screen captures at maximum resolution
- Device in realistic context
- Multi-device responsive views
- Flow sequences (3-5 screens showing a journey)

**Craft Details**
- Typography specimens (type scale, pairings, weights in use)
- Color palette in context (not just swatches — colors working in the UI)
- Icon families (consistent style, weight, corner radius)
- Component close-ups (buttons, forms, cards)
- State progressions (default → hover → active → complete)

**Input & Focus States**
- Keyboard visible with active input field
- Focus states for navigation (shows accessibility awareness)
- Text selection, cursor states

**Motion**
- Micro-interaction loops (2-5 seconds)
- Prototype recordings
- Transition demonstrations

**Edge Cases & Thoroughness**
- Empty states (first-time user, zero results, empty inbox)
- Error states and validation
- Loading states
- Offline handling

**Data & Content Variation**
- How the design handles long names, short names
- Full data vs. sparse data
- One item vs. many items
- Real edge cases the design accommodates

**Personality Moments** *(when the project has them)*
- Onboarding illustrations
- Success/celebration states (confetti, checkmarks, micro-delights)
- Error states with personality (not just red text)
- Brand voice showing through UI copy

**Platform Polish**
- iOS: status bar, notch/Dynamic Island, home indicator, safe areas
- Android: system navigation, status bar
- Web: browser chrome, responsive behavior, cursor states

**Modes & Theming**
- Dark mode / light mode (if the project has both)
- Brand theme variations (if applicable)

## Consistency & Thematic Styling

**Device Mockups**

**Recommendation:** Show your work in context — iPhone frames, browser chrome, device bezels. It feels more legitimate when viewers can see the design where it actually lives. This is the default.

Pick one style and stick with it across all projects:
- Realistic device photography
- Minimal device frames
- Clay 3D models
- Illustrated/line-drawn devices

**Exception:** Floating screens with no device frame. Only if you have a strong visual style and a specific reason. If you're unsure, use device context.

Mixing a realistic iPhone on one project, a clay model on another, and an illustrated frame on a third looks like you overlooked it — not like a deliberate choice.

**Exception:** A consistent theme with intentional variation. For example, clay device mockups that shift hue to match each project's primary color. The system stays the same, the details flex. This reads as thoughtful, not random.

**Cropping & Framing**
If you crop details to the lower-left third on one image, consider echoing that approach elsewhere. Consistent crop positions, consistent padding, consistent relationship between UI and frame edge. These small decisions compound into a cohesive style.

**Backgrounds**
Same idea — pick a treatment and repeat it:
- Solid colors (shifting per project is fine)
- Gradients (if that's your thing)
- Neutral/minimal
- Environmental/contextual

**The Goal**
Every detail you unify creates subconscious cohesion across your entire portfolio image collection. The viewer doesn't notice the system — they just feel that you've paid attention.

## Image Mix

| Type | Ratio |
|------|-------|
| Direct interface (straight-on, high-res, easy to see) | ~80% |
| Lifestyle/context (device in environment) | ~10% |
| Detail highlights (zoomed components, system details) | ~10% |

**Per project:** 3-12 images. More is better if quality holds. Fewer images = higher bar per image. Three stunning images beats twelve mediocre ones.

## What to Include

- Real content (actual copy, realistic data, names and numbers that feel true)
- Consistent mockup style within each project
- One cover image per project (the ultimate hook, works as grid thumbnail)

---

## What to Avoid

- Low-resolution screenshots
- Random angled devices that add nothing
- Inconsistent mockup styles within a project
- Lorem ipsum when real content would be better
- Over-designed presentation that competes with the work

---

## Format Baseline

Start with **1:1 (square)**. Expand to 16:9 or 4:3 for heroes if needed. Keeps things manageable.

---

## Questions to Ask Yourself Per Project

- What's the single most impressive screen? (That's probably your cover)
- Where is the craft hiding? (Typography, spacing, color, icons — pull it out and show it)
- What states exist beyond the happy path? (Empty, error, loading — these show thoroughness)
- Is there motion or interaction worth capturing? (Even a simple hover state can demonstrate polish)
- What makes this project *yours*? (The detail or decision that someone else wouldn't have made)

## The Only Real Rule

Every image must be **fantastic**. Not good. Not fine. Fantastic.

If it doesn't make you stop scrolling, keep working.
