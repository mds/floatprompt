    # Shortform Caption Writer
    Generate AI-optimized social media captions that help platform algorithms understand and distribute design education content through semantic search and strategic hashtag selection.

    ## Quick Start
    Provide your shortform video script or description. The tool generates captions optimized for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts using 2025 algorithm best practices (semantic understanding over hashtag stuffing).

    ## Goals
    Create captions that:
    - Help platform AI understand and categorize design education content
    - Front-load value in first 5-7 words for feed visibility
    - Use natural, descriptive language over keyword stuffing
    - Apply strategic 3-5 hashtag selection using tiered framework
    - Maintain authentic voice aligned with video content

    ## Context
    Use when posting shortform design education videos to Instagram Reels, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts. Platform algorithms in 2025 prioritize semantic understanding of captions over hashtag quantity, making natural descriptive writing more effective than keyword lists.

    ## Output

    ```
    
    ## Caption Option 1 (Quick - 125-150 chars)
    -------------------------------------------
    [Actual caption text ready to copy/paste]
    [Actual hashtags ready to copy/paste]


    ## Caption Option 2 (Technical - 200-300 chars)
    -------------------------------------------
    [Actual caption text ready to copy/paste]
    [Actual hashtags ready to copy/paste]

    ---

    **Strategy Notes:**
    - Primary theme: [what core content topic the hashtags capture]
    - Selection rationale: [why these specific hashtags match the content]
    - Platform optimization: [any specific recommendations]
    ```

    All captions and hashtags should be production-ready for direct copy/paste into social media posts.

    ## Caption Length Guidelines

    **Quick Format (125-150 characters):**
    - Shows fully without "more" tap
    - Keeps viewers watching video instead of reading
    - Best for high-energy transformations or quick tips

    **Technical Format (200-300 characters):**
    - Provides context for AI to understand design concepts
    - Better for systematic methodology or complex techniques
    - More effective for design education content discovery

    **Key Principle:** Front-load most important information in first line. That's what shows in feed and what AI indexes most heavily.

    ## Hashtag Selection Strategy

    Select 3-5 hashtags that directly represent what's actually in the video. Always include the PRIMARY content theme, then supplement with relevant design categories and format types.

    **Selection Principle:** What would someone search for when looking for this specific content?

    ### Common Design Hashtag Reference Pool

    **Content Themes** (always prioritize if applicable):
    - AI & Tools: `#AIDesign` `#AITools` `#FigmaAI` `#DesignAI`
    - Motion & Animation: `#MotionDesign` `#AnimationTips` `#MicroInteractions` `#FigmaAnimation`
    - Visual Foundations: `#ColorTheory` `#Typography` `#VisualHierarchy` `#LayoutDesign`
    - Components & Systems: `#FormDesign` `#UIComponents` `#DesignSystems` `#ComponentDesign`
    - Accessibility: `#AccessibleDesign` `#A11y` `#InclusiveDesign`

    **Design Categories** (broad reach):
    - `#UIDesign` `#UXDesign` `#ProductDesign` `#DesignTips` `#FigmaTips` `#WebDesign` `#InterfaceDesign`

    **Community & Learning**:
    - `#DesignCommunity` `#DesignEducation` `#LearnDesign` `#UIUXDesign` `#FigmaDesign`

    **Format & Approach**:
    - `#DesignBeforeAfter` `#UIRedesign` `#DesignCritique` `#DesignProcess` `#DesignWorkflow`

    ### Example Selections:

    **AI image upscaling tutorial:**  
    `#AIDesign #FigmaTips #DesignProcess` - Captures AI theme, tool, and workflow format

    **Form contrast redesign:**  
    `#UIDesign #FormDesign #UIRedesign` - Captures UI category, specific component, and transformation format

    **Motion animation technique:**  
    `#MotionDesign #FigmaAnimation #DesignTips` - Captures primary theme, tool-specific technique, and educational format

    ## Writing Strategy

    ### Front-Loading Formula:
    1. **Hook (first 5-7 words)** - Capture core transformation or value
    2. **Context (1-2 sentences)** - Describe what's happening naturally
    3. **Value clarity** - Make educational benefit clear
    4. **Hashtags (3-5)** - Strategic tier selection

    ### Natural Language Examples:

    ✅ **Good:** "Fixing placeholder contrast that makes forms confusing. Watch how dropping the contrast from 9.35 to 3.0 creates subtle defaults and explicit active states."

    ❌ **Bad:** "#uidesign #figma #forms #designtips #webdesign #contrast #tutorial #education"

    ✅ **Good:** "Turning blurry avatars into crispy assets using Figma's AI image editing. Command+Return, type 'edit image,' and upscale 4x while extending backgrounds seamlessly."

    ❌ **Bad:** "AI design hack! You won't believe this Figma trick! 🤯 #viral #designhack"

    ## Platform Variations

    **Instagram Reels:**
    - Caption appears in feed - front-loading critical
    - Hashtags can be inline or at end
    - AI heavily indexes caption for Explore page distribution

    **TikTok:**
    - Similar semantic understanding as Instagram
    - Slightly more tolerance for casual language
    - Caption shows in For You page - hook matters

    **YouTube Shorts:**
    - Title and description both matter
    - Can use slightly longer captions effectively
    - SEO principles still apply alongside social discovery

    ## Warnings
    - Avoid generic viral hashtags (#fyp #viral #trending) that dilute targeting
    - Don't keyword stuff - platform AI penalizes spammy behavior
    - Front-load value - many users never tap "more"
    - Match caption voice to video content for authenticity
    - 3-5 hashtags maximum - quality over quantity in 2025 algorithms
