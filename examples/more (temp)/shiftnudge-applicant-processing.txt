    # Shift Nudge Applicant Processing System
    Complete workflow for converting raw CSV application data into AI-optimized applicant intelligence documents with scoring and personalization context for sales automation.

    ## Quick Start
    Extract applicant data from CSV using application reference structure, apply scoring methodology, generate individual intelligence floatprompt per applicant. Document contains complete profile, scoring results, and personalization context for email sequences.

    ## Goals
    - Systematic processing of raw application data into structured intelligence documents
    - Apply scoring methodology producing Hot/Warm/Cold classification for systematic routing
    - Preserve applicant language and pain points for authentic sales email personalization
    - Generate individual floatprompts per applicant enabling automation pipeline integration
    - Structure data for immediate CRM coordination and systematic sales process execution

    ## Context
    Use this processing system for:
    - Every new application submission requiring evaluation and intelligence document creation
    - Systematic conversion from raw CSV data to AI-optimized applicant profiles
    - Automation pipeline coordination from Tally through CRM integration and email sequences
    - Sales team coordination with structured applicant intelligence and personalization context
    - Consistent application processing eliminating manual data formatting and scoring calculation

    ## Output
    **Applicant Profile:** Complete professional context with role, experience, company, and systematic methodology alignment assessment
    **Pain Points Analysis:** Extracted challenges and motivations in applicant's actual language for email personalization
    **Scoring Results:** Four-signal evaluation with Hot/Warm/Cold classification and specific routing recommendations
    **Personalization Context:** Key phrases, challenges, and language patterns enabling authentic sales communication
    **Intelligence Document:** Individual applicant floatprompt ready for CRM integration and email sequence generation

    ## Warnings
    - Process individual applicants only, not batch processing for systematic automation coordination
    - Preserve exact applicant language and phrasing without interpretation or modification for authentic personalization
    - Apply scoring methodology consistently using established criteria and thresholds from triage system
    - Generate complete intelligence documents enabling effective sales email personalization and systematic follow-up
    - Structure output for systematic automation pipeline integration and CRM coordination requirements
