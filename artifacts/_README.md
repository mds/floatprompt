# 📁 FloatPrompt Artifacts

This folder contains all development artifacts created during the evolution of the `FloatPrompt` system.

## 🔗 Folder Linkage

This directory is symlinked into the active Obsidian vault at:

/Users/mds/Documents/_Github/floatprompt/artifacts

It is linked **from**:

/Users/mds/Documents/Obsidian/floatprompt/artifacts

## 🧠 Purpose

Artifacts stored here serve as a **public historical record** of how floatprompt was developed using floatprompt.

Each file reflects:

- Archaeological thinking
- System breakthroughs
- Voice-preserved development sessions
- Pattern discoveries
- Real-world application of floatPrompt modes and principles

## ✍️ Naming Convention

All files follow the **Preserved Intelligence** format:

[YYYY-MM-DD]-[0000]-[descriptive-name].md


This ensures temporal traceability and naming clarity.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always create new artifacts in this folder via Obsidian or Git
- Use `git mv` when renaming to preserve history
- Treat this folder as **public and permanent**
- Preserve original voice and phrasing when writing artifact content
