# Artifacts

Historical archive and active specifications for FloatPrompt evolution.

## Current Specifications

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **float-buoys-commands-spec.md** | Float Buoys via Claude Code — `/float` and `/float sync` commands (active) |
| **float-buoys-test.md** | Step-by-step test plan for validating the buoy system |
| **float-buoys-daemon-spec.md** | Float Buoys via Node.js daemon — background file watcher (tabled for now) |
| **float-buoys-context.md** | Strategic context and decision rationale for both specs |
| **floatprompt-npm-scaffold-spec.md** | npm package scaffold specification (uses `_float/` architecture) |

**Note:** Starting with the simpler commands approach. Daemon spec preserved for future if real-time sync is needed.

## Session Summaries

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **2025-12-28-cursor-summary.md** | AI context snapshot after FloatSystem boot sequence |
| **2025-12-28-cursor-context-build-path.md** | Documented path of 24 files read to achieve full context |

## Historical Archive

See `2025/_float/index.md` for historical specs, explorations, and session handoffs that document the evolution from flat structure to `_float/` container architecture.

## Subfolders

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **2025/** | Historical archive — 150+ files documenting FloatPrompt evolution throughout 2025 |

## Key Documents

**For understanding the FloatSystem vision:**
- Start with `floatprompt-vision-2025-12-28.md`
- Then `floatstructure-specification.md` for architecture
- Then individual specs as needed

**For historical context:**
- See `2025/_float/index.md` for comprehensive TOC of 150+ historical files
- Organized by category: specifications, breakthroughs, manifestos, etc.

## Note

The specifications in this folder are **drafts** from the FloatSystem genesis session. They need real-world validation but the architecture is sound.

This folder is actively maintained. New specifications and session logs are added as FloatPrompt evolves.
