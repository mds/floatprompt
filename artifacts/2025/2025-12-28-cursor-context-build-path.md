# Cursor Context Build Path

How an AI agent built complete FloatPrompt understanding through systematic file reading.

---

## Summary

**24 files** read in sequence following the FloatSystem boot protocol, progressing from architecture to philosophy to practical examples.

**Result:** Full operational context — architecture, philosophy, methodology, voice preservation, real examples, project state.

---

## MDS Loops

Context building follows the MDS methodology: **Map → Decide → Structure**, looped as necessary.

```
Loop 1: Boot
├── Map: Read system.md, index.md
├── Decide: Follow boot sequence
└── Structure: Initial awareness

Loop 2: Verify
├── Map: Traverse all index files
├── Decide: Check integrity
└── Structure: Confirmed project state

Loop 3: Deepen
├── Map: Read template, OS, manifesto
├── Decide: Focus on philosophy
└── Structure: Understood the "why"

Loop 4: Ground
├── Map: Read real examples
├── Decide: See the spectrum
└── Structure: Practical understanding

Loop 5: Complete
├── Map: What's still fuzzy?
├── Decide: Fill specific gaps
└── Structure: Full context achieved
```

Each loop corresponds to a phase below. The phases document *what* was read; the loops show *how* understanding was built.

---

## Phase 1: Boot Sequence (FloatSystem Activation) — Loop 1

| # | File | What I Learned |
|---|------|----------------|
| 1 | `_float/index.md` | Repo structure, file format overview, goal hierarchy summary |
| 2 | `_float/system.md` | 9-step penetration sequence, maintenance protocol, behavioral constraints |
| 3 | `_float/logs/2025-12-28.md` | Today was FloatSystem genesis day, major architecture migration happened |

**Outcome:** Understood the boot protocol and current project state.

---

## Phase 2: Index Traversal (Integrity Verification) — Loop 2

| # | File | What I Learned |
|---|------|----------------|
| 4 | `docs/_float/index.md` | Reading order, key concepts summary |
| 5 | `context/_float/index.md` | Onboarding document purpose |
| 6 | `dev/_float/index.md` | Update-creator and update-protocol workflow |
| 7 | `experimental/_float/index.md` | Legacy build system, archived status |
| 8 | `artifacts/_float/index.md` | 150+ historical evolution documents |
| 9 | `docs/philosophy/_float/index.md` | Manifesto, orientation, naming docs exist |
| 10 | `docs/reference/_float/index.md` | Full/mini/micro complexity levels |
| 11 | `dev/updates/_float/index.md` | Closed vs in-progress update structure |
| 12 | `artifacts/2025/_float/index.md` | Key breakthrough documents from 2025 |

**Outcome:** Verified all `_float/index.md` files, confirmed structure matches reality.

---

## Phase 3: Key Documentation (Mental Model) — Loop 3

| # | File | What I Learned |
|---|------|----------------|
| 13 | `docs/goals.md` | Strict three-tier priority: voice > behavior > artifacts |
| 14 | `docs/principles.md` | Recognition before action, slow is smooth, anti-patterns |

**Outcome:** Internalized the goal hierarchy and operating principles.

---

## Phase 4: Deep Dive (Full Understanding) — Loop 3 continued

| # | File | What I Learned |
|---|------|----------------|
| 15 | `context/float-context.md` | Three-component distinction: FloatDoc/FloatPrompt/FloatSystem |
| 16 | `floatprompt.md` | Placeholder structure, MANDATORY_FLOATPROMPT_PROTOCOL, activation triggers |
| 17 | `docs/philosophy/manifesto.md` | *Why* FloatPrompt exists: "human intelligence gets lost in translation" |
| 18 | `floatprompt-os.md` | Boot sequence presentation, Map/Decide/Structure modes, friction pipeline, Voice Preservation Oath |

**Outcome:** Understood the template, the OS, and the philosophical foundation.

---

## Phase 5: Real Examples (Practical Grounding) — Loop 4

| # | File | What I Learned |
|---|------|----------------|
| 19 | `examples/ai portfolio coach/ai-portfolio-coach-v1.txt` | Multi-phase guidance, HTML artifacts, embedded philosophy, 729 lines |
| 20 | `examples/design feedback extractor/design_feedback_extractor.txt` | Minimal/surgical approach, archaeological extraction, 86 lines |
| 21 | `examples/shortform script writer/.../shortform-script-writer.txt` | Tool chaining, production packages, framework integration, 200 lines |

**Outcome:** Saw the full spectrum from simple extractors to complex coaches.

---

## Phase 6: Gap Filling (Completeness) — Loop 5

| # | File | What I Learned |
|---|------|----------------|
| 22 | `floatdoc.md` | Field ownership model, "AI as QA manager" |
| 23 | `docs/voice.md` | What to preserve/avoid, em dash addiction warning, read-aloud test |
| 24 | `docs/mds-method.md` | "Structure follows decisions" principle, depth scaling |

**Outcome:** Filled remaining gaps for complete context.

---

## Context Domains Achieved

| Domain | Status | Source Files |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Architecture | Complete | 1, 2, 15 |
| Philosophy | Complete | 13, 14, 17 |
| Methodology | Complete | 18, 24 |
| Voice Preservation | Complete | 18, 23 |
| File Formats | Complete | 15, 16, 22 |
| Real Examples | Complete | 19, 20, 21 |
| Project State | Complete | 3, 4-12 |

---

## Key Insights from the Build

1. **Boot sequence works.** Following `_float/system.md` instructions produced comprehensive understanding.

2. **Index traversal catches gaps.** Reading all `_float/index.md` files verified structure and revealed folder purposes.

3. **Examples ground theory.** The Portfolio Coach example (729 lines) showed what "depth scales with complexity" actually means.

4. **The manifesto connects everything.** Understanding *why* FloatPrompt exists ("human intelligence gets lost") reframes all technical decisions.

5. **Voice preservation is the core constraint.** Every architectural choice serves the goal of not diminishing human expression.

---

## Replication Instructions

To achieve this context in a new session:

1. Start with `_float/system.md` (boot loader)
2. Follow the penetration sequence exactly
3. Read examples after documentation
4. Fill gaps based on what feels incomplete

**Minimum viable context:** Files 1, 2, 13, 14, 16, 17 (6 files for core understanding)

**Full context:** All 24 files as documented above
