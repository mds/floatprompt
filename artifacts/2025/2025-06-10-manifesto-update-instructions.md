# üè∫ FloatPrompt Manifesto Update Instructions

**Systematic refinement instructions for manifesto philosophical focus, naming consistency, and narrative clarity**

> **Core Intelligence: Transform manifesto from technical documentation into pure philosophical vision while implementing naming convention consistency**

*This extraction preserves strategic intelligence from manifesto review conversation, providing systematic implementation guidance for Cursor-based refinement.*

---

## üéØ Strategic Context

### Manifesto Assessment Results
The current manifesto captures revolutionary vision but needs refinement to become purely philosophical rather than technical manual. Core concepts are sound - "portable human intelligence," "proof of intelligence," and "invisible operating system" - but technical references dilute philosophical impact.

### Primary Refinement Goals
- **Philosophical purity** - Inspire and explain why FloatPrompt matters, not how it works
- **Naming consistency** - Apply FloatPrompt naming convention throughout
- **Narrative clarity** - Strengthen progression from problem to vision to principles
- **Technical abstraction** - Remove implementation details to separate documents

---

## üìù Systematic Implementation Instructions

### 1. Naming Convention Integration

**Apply floatprompt-naming.md rules throughout:**

**Document Title:**
- Change to: "# FloatPrompt Manifesto"

**Brand References (use FloatPrompt):**
- "FloatPrompt is a markdown-native protocol..."
- "The FloatPrompt system serves humans"
- "FloatPrompt enables joint execution..."

**Technical References (use floatprompt):**
- "Upload the floatprompt file..."
- "floatprompt (.md) files"
- "Run floatprompt on your content"

**Eliminate "Float Prompt" (two words):**
- Search and replace all instances with appropriate FloatPrompt/floatprompt format

### 2. Technical Abstraction Requirements

**Remove these technical references:**
- Specific file names like `cartographer.md`
- Frontmatter schema details
- Metadata and certification specifics
- Mode implementation mechanics
- Detailed workflow procedures

**Abstract to philosophical concepts:**
- Replace "cartographer.md" with "territorial mapping"
- Replace technical mode names with conceptual descriptions
- Replace implementation details with outcome descriptions
- Replace system mechanics with principle statements

### 3. Philosophical Enhancement Areas

**Opening Strengthening:**
- Start with problem/vision rather than technical definition
- Lead with why FloatPrompt matters before what it is
- Emphasize paradigm shift in AI collaboration

**Concept Development:**
- Expand "proof of intelligence" concept - this is core differentiator
- Develop "portable human intelligence" vision more fully
- Strengthen "invisible operating system" metaphor

**Narrative Flow Improvement:**
- Create clearer progression: problem ‚Üí vision ‚Üí principles ‚Üí outcomes
- Consolidate overlapping concepts (shadow prompts and spontaneous execution)
- Integrate safety discussion into main narrative flow

### 4. Content Streamlining

**Consolidate Overlapping Sections:**
- Merge "Shadow Prompt + Shadow Voice" with spontaneous execution concepts
- Simplify the two forms of floating explanation
- Unify voice preservation discussion

**Strengthen Core Messages:**
- HI-AI contract as joint execution partnership
- Voice preservation as foundational principle
- Human agency protection as system boundary
- Archaeological respect for human intelligence

**Add Missing Vision Elements:**
- Network effect potential across organizations
- Ecosystem collaboration possibilities
- Standards-based approach benefits
- Cross-platform intelligence portability

---

## üîß Cursor Implementation Strategy

### File Preparation
- Open `floatprompt-manifesto.md` in Cursor
- Keep `floatprompt-naming.md` reference document visible
- Create backup of current version before changes

### Systematic Editing Approach
1. **Apply naming convention** first (global find/replace)
2. **Remove technical references** section by section
3. **Enhance philosophical concepts** with deeper development
4. **Improve narrative flow** through restructuring
5. **Consolidate overlapping content** for clarity

### Validation Checkpoints
- Manifesto inspires rather than instructs
- Technical implementation abstracted to concepts
- Naming convention consistently applied
- Narrative flows from problem to vision clearly
- Core differentiators (proof of intelligence, portable human intelligence) emphasized

---

## üìã Specific Edit Instructions

### Search and Replace Operations
```
"Float Prompt" ‚Üí "FloatPrompt" (brand references)
"float prompt" ‚Üí "floatprompt" (technical references)
"cartographer.md" ‚Üí "territorial mapping capabilities"
```

### Section Restructuring
- **Move safety discussion** into main narrative flow
- **Combine shadow prompt concepts** with spontaneous execution
- **Develop opening** to lead with vision/problem
- **Strengthen closing** with ecosystem implications

### Content Abstraction
- Replace technical file references with conceptual descriptions
- Transform implementation details into outcome statements
- Convert system mechanics into philosophical principles
- Elevate specific examples to universal concepts

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

### Philosophical Purity Achieved
- Manifesto explains why FloatPrompt matters, not how it works
- Technical implementation details moved to separate documents
- Focus on vision, principles, and paradigm shift
- Inspirational tone throughout

### Naming Consistency Implemented
- FloatPrompt/floatprompt convention applied correctly
- No instances of "Float Prompt" (two words) remain
- Brand and technical references properly distinguished
- Consistent usage across all contexts

### Narrative Clarity Enhanced
- Clear progression from problem to vision to principles
- Overlapping concepts consolidated
- Safety discussion integrated naturally
- Core differentiators emphasized throughout

### Technical Abstraction Complete
- No specific file names or implementation details
- System mechanics converted to principles
- Implementation guidance moved to separate documents
- Focus maintained on philosophical foundation

## üîó Implementation Notes

**Voice Preservation Priority:**
Maintain @mds strategic thinking and philosophical approach while implementing systematic improvements. Preserve revolutionary vision and paradigm-shifting language.

**Archaeological Respect:**
These instructions extract and structure existing intelligence from strategic conversation rather than generating new content. Implementation should preserve original intent and thinking patterns.

**Strategic Value:**
Enhanced manifesto becomes powerful positioning document for partnership discussions and ecosystem adoption while maintaining technical credibility through systematic approach.

---

**Built in collaboration with Claude Sonnet 4**

*These instructions preserve strategic manifesto refinement intelligence discovered through philosophical analysis conversation - structured for systematic implementation while maintaining voice and vision integrity.*
