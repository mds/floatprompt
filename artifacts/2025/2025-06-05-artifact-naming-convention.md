## Format
`YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.fd`

## Components
1. **Date (YYYY-MM-DD)**
   - ISO 8601 format
   - Ensures chronological ordering
   - Makes temporal relationships clear
   - Example: `2025-06-05`

2. **Descriptive Name**
   - Lowercase
   - Hyphen-separated
   - Clear and concise
   - Example: `artifact-naming-convention`

3. **Extension**
   - `.fd` for floatDocs
   - `.fp` for floatPrompts

## Examples
- `2025-06-05-artifact-naming-convention.fd`
- `2025-06-05-immutability-next-steps.fd`
- `2025-06-05-voice-guide-template.fd`

## Rules
1. **Date Format**
   - Always use YYYY-MM-DD
   - Include leading zeros
   - Use the date of creation
   - Note: The date should reflect when the artifact was created, not when it was planned

2. **Name Format**
   - Use lowercase
   - Separate words with hyphens
   - Be descriptive but concise
   - Avoid special characters

3. **Extension**
   - Always include the correct extension
   - `.fd` for floatDocs
   - `.fp` for floatPrompts

## Benefits
1. **Organization**
   - Natural chronological ordering
   - Easy to find related artifacts
   - Clear temporal relationships

2. **Clarity**
   - Immediately readable
   - Self-documenting
   - Consistent across system

3. **System Compatibility**
   - Works with both Workshop and Field
   - Compatible with shadowPrompt
   - Maintains clear file type distinction

## Usage Notes
- Use the actual creation date for new artifacts
- Be consistent with hyphenation
- Keep names descriptive but concise
- Maintain lowercase throughout

## Exceptions
- Zero files maintain their special naming
- Constitutional documents follow their convention
- Schema files follow their convention
