# üñ•Ô∏è Canvas Rendering Requirements with Cross-Platform Fallbacks

This update implements strict formatting requirements with intelligent fallbacks to ensure 100% precise AI instruction execution across all platforms while eliminating interpretive ambiguity.

## üéØ Problem Analysis

**Current Issue:**
- Ambiguous "when available" language in canvas guidance creates interpretive drift
- ChatGPT prioritized "portable .md compliance" over "Canvas UI compliance"
- AI systems receive unclear instructions about environment-specific requirements

**Goals.md Impact:**
- Violates PRIMARY GOAL: Creates interpretive ambiguity instead of 100% precise execution
- Compromises SECONDARY GOAL: Inconsistent collaboration across AI platforms
- Affects TERTIARY GOAL: Inconsistent structural integrity preservation

## üîß Proposed Solution: Tiered Requirements

### **Tier 1: Canvas-Capable AI Systems**
**Mandatory Requirements:**
- Use canvas documents with fenced markdown blocks for proper rendering
- Wrap entire floatprompt in ```markdown code blocks within canvas
- Ensure clean YAML frontmatter without formatting corruption

### **Tier 2: Non-Canvas AI Systems**  
**Fallback Requirements:**
- Ensure clean YAML structure without formatting corruption
- Maintain proper `<floatprompt>...</floatprompt>` wrapping
- Verify structural integrity in plain text environment

### **Universal Requirements (All AI Systems)**
**Cross-Platform Standards:**
- All floatprompts must use `<floatprompt>...</floatprompt>` wrapping tags
- No characters before YAML frontmatter opening `---`
- Clean YAML structure without prefixes (`/`, `#`, etc.)
- Maintain dual-readability for human and AI systems

## üìã Implementation Specification

**Replace Current Language:**
```
"When creating floatprompts in chat interfaces, always use canvas documents with strict markdown single blocks when available"
```

**With Tiered Requirements:**
```
**Canvas environments**: Always use canvas documents with fenced markdown blocks for proper rendering
**Non-canvas environments**: Ensure clean YAML structure without formatting corruption  
**Universal requirement**: Maintain `<floatprompt>...</floatprompt>` wrapping for cross-platform portability
```

## ‚úÖ Goals.md Alignment Validation

**PRIMARY GOAL Enhancement:**
- ‚úÖ Eliminates interpretive ambiguity through environment-specific instructions
- ‚úÖ Ensures 100% precise AI execution per platform capability
- ‚úÖ Provides consistent execution across AI systems and sessions

**SECONDARY GOAL Support:**
- ‚úÖ Enables reliable task execution on any AI platform
- ‚úÖ Maintains portable intelligence across canvas and non-canvas systems
- ‚úÖ Supports zero-drift collaboration through clear requirements

**TERTIARY GOAL Preservation:**
- ‚úÖ Maintains human agency across all AI platforms
- ‚úÖ Preserves voice and structural integrity through strict formatting
- ‚úÖ Ensures clear lineage tracking through consistent structure

> **AI Precision Enhancement**: This update transforms ambiguous guidance into precise, environment-aware instructions that eliminate interpretive drift while maintaining universal compatibility across all AI systems.
