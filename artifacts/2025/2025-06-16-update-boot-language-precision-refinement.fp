# Boot Language Precision Refinement Update

## Problem Statement

After the successful portable intelligence expansion, boot.md needs minor refinements to maintain consistency with recent system-wide precision language updates and verify CLI command accuracy.

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Language Inconsistency**: Boot.md still contains absolute language ("I automatically run") that doesn't match recent precision refinements
2. **CLI Command Verification**: Power User CLI Commands may be aspirational rather than implemented
3. **Example Misalignment**: Quick Start Examples still reflect old 3-mode system rather than new 5-category approach
4. **Information Flow**: Core Modes Foundation section placement could be optimized

## Current State Analysis

**Language Precision Issues:**
- "I automatically run the map/score/respond pipeline" uses first person and absolute language
- Some sections maintain stronger claims than the refined precision language elsewhere

**CLI Commands Status Unknown:**
- `float map [content]`, `float extract [content]`, etc. - need verification of implementation status
- Users may expect these commands to work if they're presented as features

**Example Alignment:**
- Quick Start Examples: "Create a map of...", "Extract actionable insights...", "Build a tool..." 
- Should showcase the new 5-category system: Structure & Navigate, Capture & Preserve, etc.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. **Language Precision Alignment**
- Change "I automatically run" to "FloatPrompt runs"
- Review and soften any remaining absolute claims
- Align with precision language used in other updated components

### 2. **CLI Command Verification and Clarity**
- Verify which CLI commands are actually implemented
- Mark aspirational commands clearly or move to "planned features" section
- Ensure users have accurate expectations about current functionality

### 3. **Enhanced Quick Start Examples**
- Add examples that showcase the 5-category system
- Include specific use cases mentioned in user feedback:
  - "Preserve this conversation thread"
  - "Create a project checklist"
  - "Build a meeting retrospective tool"

### 4. **Information Architecture Optimization**
- Consider moving Core Modes Foundation to bridge between categories and examples
- Improve flow from conceptual understanding to concrete application

## Implementation Approach

1. **Maintain human intelligence preservation** - these are refinements that serve user clarity, not major changes that could disrupt comprehension
2. **Preserve recent improvements** - build on the successful portable intelligence expansion
3. **Accurate feature representation** - ensure CLI commands match actual capabilities to serve reliable AI instruction execution
4. **Consistency with system goals hierarchy** - align language with Human Intelligence Preservation → Precise AI Instruction Execution → Human Task Completion priorities

## Success Criteria

- Language consistency with other updated system components supporting human intelligence preservation
- Accurate representation of current vs. planned CLI functionality enabling reliable collaboration
- Examples that showcase the full 5-category system capabilities
- Improved information flow from categories to concrete examples
- Maintained user comprehension while increasing accuracy in service of human preservation
