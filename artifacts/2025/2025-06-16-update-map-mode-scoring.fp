# Map Mode System Implementation

**Implement mandatory friction classification and response selection for all FloatPrompt inputs to prevent premature execution on complex content.**

## üéØ Change Overview

This update implements the foundational `map / score / respond` diagnostic layer that must precede all FloatPrompt execution. Every input receives a friction score that determines safe execution pathways, with automatic reclassification as conversations expand.

## üîÑ Three-Phase Pipeline

### 1. Map Phase
- Evaluate content cohesion, formatting clarity, topic segmentation
- Assign structure score 1-10 based on complexity assessment using heuristics of cohesion, segmentation, and formatting density
- Generate baseline content understanding

### 2. Score Phase  
- Apply friction scoring algorithm using word count and structure multiplier
- Structure score (1‚Äì10) is generated during the Map phase, not user-supplied or arbitrary
- Implement edge case overrides for high complexity/volume
- Classify into friction buckets (üü©üü®üü•)

### 3. Respond Phase
- Select appropriate response pattern based on friction classification
- Determine available execution pathways
- Apply behavioral constraints based on friction level

## üßÆ Scoring Algorithm Implementation

### Core Formula
```
friction_score = word_count √ó structure_multiplier
```

### Structure Multiplier Scale (Nonlinear)
- Structure 1 ‚Üí 1.00
- Structure 2 ‚Üí 1.05  
- Structure 3 ‚Üí 1.10
- Structure 4 ‚Üí 1.18
- Structure 5 ‚Üí 1.30
- Structure 6 ‚Üí 1.45
- Structure 7 ‚Üí 1.65
- Structure 8 ‚Üí 1.90
- Structure 9 ‚Üí 2.10
- Structure 10 ‚Üí 2.50

### Edge Case Overrides
- If structure score ‚â• 9: minimum friction score = 1200
- If word count > 3000: minimum friction score = 2500

### Friction Classification
- **0‚Äì1200**: üü© low-friction (safe for immediate execution)
- **1201‚Äì2500**: üü® moderate-friction (recommend mapping first)
- **2501+**: üü• high-friction (require mapping before execution)

## üîÑ Reclassification Protocol

### Trigger Conditions
- Conversation word count crosses friction threshold boundaries
- Content complexity increases significantly during interaction
- Multi-turn exchanges expand beyond original input scope

### Re-evaluation Logic
```
total_conversation_words = original_input + all_subsequent_exchanges
recalculate_friction_score = total_conversation_words √ó current_structure_multiplier
if new_score > current_classification_threshold:
    upgrade_friction_level()
    apply_new_behavioral_constraints()
```

### Classification Updates
- **üü© ‚Üí üü®**: When conversation expands beyond 1200 word threshold
- **üü® ‚Üí üü•**: When conversation expands beyond 2500 word threshold  
- **Upgrade behavior**: Apply more restrictive behavioral patterns
- **No downgrades**: Classifications can only increase in friction level

## üõ°Ô∏è System Behavior Changes

### Mandatory Pipeline
- All input must pass through map/score/respond pipeline
- No mode (extract, build, critique) may execute without classification
- Response phase occurs before any recommendations are offered

### Response Phase Behaviors
- **üü© low-friction**: "Proceed freely, mapping optional"
- **üü® moderate-friction**: "Recommend mapping, allow override, flag output as unanchored" 
- **üü• high-friction**: "Require full mapping before execution, block premature extract/build"

### Reclassification Enforcement
- Monitor conversation expansion automatically
- Trigger re-evaluation when thresholds are crossed
- Apply upgraded behavioral constraints immediately
- Notify user of classification changes transparently

## üß† Strategic Rationale

This implementation directly supports the core FloatPrompt principles:

- **Recognition Before Action**: No execution until input structure is assessed
- **Slow is Smooth**: Graduated friction responses prevent rushing on complex content
- **Voice Preservation**: Mapping requirements protect against flattening and drift
- **Human Agency**: Systematic assessment enables informed execution decisions

## üîó Integration Points

### Template System
- Add scoring logic to ingestion processing
- Implement friction classification in boot sequence
- Update mode entry points to respect scoring

### Behavioral Constraints
- Extract mode blocked for üü• inputs without mapping
- Build mode requires friction assessment before execution
- Recommendation system filtered by friction classification

### User Experience
- Transparent scoring communication
- Clear friction bucket explanations
- Mapping recommendations based on classification

## üìã Implementation Checklist (v0.1.1)

This checklist governs implementation before friction classification becomes system-default. Must be completed before next version bump.

- [ ] Add map/score/respond pipeline to template system
- [ ] Implement structure score generation in map phase using cohesion/segmentation/formatting heuristics
- [ ] Create friction bucket classification logic
- [ ] Define respond phase behavior patterns matching canonical strategy language
- [ ] Add scoring enforcement to all execution modes
- [ ] Implement conversation tracking and reclassification logic
- [ ] Add threshold crossing detection and upgrade mechanisms
- [ ] Update boot sequence to include pipeline diagnostics
- [ ] Integrate response selection with recommendation system
- [ ] Add user-facing classification communication and change notifications
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect pipeline and reclassification protocol

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Compliance

- Pipeline cannot be bypassed or disabled
- All execution paths must respect current friction classification
- Reclassification always upgrades friction level, never downgrades
- Edge case overrides prevent false low-friction classification
- Algorithm implementation must match specification exactly
- Human override available but requires explicit friction acknowledgment
- Conversation expansion tracking prevents stale classification risks

**This update establishes the foundational safety layer with automatic adaptation for all FloatPrompt input processing, ensuring Recognition Before Action and Slow is Smooth principles are systematically enforced across conversation lifecycles.**
