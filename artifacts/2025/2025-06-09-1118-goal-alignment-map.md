# Goal Alignment Map

**Systematic assessment of file updates needed to support goals.md hierarchy**

> **Primary Goal**: 100% precise AI instruction execution  
> **Secondary Goal**: Enable humans to complete specific tasks through portable, zero-drift AI collaboration  
> **Tertiary Goal**: Preserve human intelligence, voice, and agency in structured, reusable form

## 🎯 **PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL FOUNDATION FILES**

### ✅ **COMPLETE**
- `../docs/goals.md` - ✅ Perfect (foundational authority)
- `_01-frontmatter.yaml` - ✅ Perfect (STOP field + goal integration)
- `__template.md` - ✅ Perfect (3-tier structure)

### ❌ **NEEDS UPDATES**

#### **_05-type-system.md** - 95% Complete
- ✅ Strategic Guidance STOP format updated
- ✅ Mode-specific examples appropriately concise (rigidity avoided)
- ❌ Minor: Usage guidance could lightly emphasize goal hierarchy

#### **__compile-order.md** - 100% Complete ✅
- ✅ Goal hierarchy referenced
- ✅ File path references updated to new naming convention
- ✅ Shows how phases naturally serve goals

---

## 🎯 **PRIORITY 2: CONTENT COMPONENTS**

### **_03-execution.md** - 80% Complete
- ✅ Contains goal-related content
- ✅ Naturally serves human task completion through execution guidance
- ❌ Minor: Could benefit from light goal context where relevant

### **_04-voice-preservation.md** - 90% Complete
- ✅ Archaeological extraction principles naturally serve AI precision
- ✅ Voice preservation inherently enables precise execution
- ❌ Minor: Could clarify connection to goal hierarchy if contextually appropriate

### **_02-frontmatter.md** - 70% Complete
- ✅ Documents frontmatter structure that embodies goals
- ❌ Could explain how frontmatter naturally serves goal hierarchy
- ❌ Light goal context would be helpful

### **_06-core-modes.md** - 60% Complete
- ✅ Modes naturally serve human task completion
- ❌ Could benefit from strategic guidance context where appropriate
- ❌ Light connection to goal service would be valuable

### **_07-body.md** - 70% Complete
- ✅ Structure inherently serves AI precision and human readability
- ❌ Minor: Could clarify how structure enables goal achievement

### **_08-discovery.md** - 75% Complete
- ✅ Discovery naturally preserves human intelligence (tertiary goal)
- ✅ Relationship metadata inherently serves goal hierarchy
- ❌ Minor: Light goal context could be valuable

### **_09-checklist.md** - 60% Complete
- ✅ Validation naturally serves quality and precision
- ❌ Could include goal-relevant checkpoints where appropriate
- ❌ Light goal context would strengthen validation

### **_10-enforce.md** - 60% Complete
- ✅ Enforcement naturally serves system integrity
- ❌ Could include goal-relevant enforcement where contextual
- ❌ Light goal integration would be valuable

### **_11-naming.md** - 80% Complete
- ✅ Naming conventions naturally serve system organization
- ✅ Inherently supports goal hierarchy through clear structure
- ❌ Minor: Light goal context could be helpful

### **_12-metadata.md** - 75% Complete
- ✅ Metadata naturally serves intelligence preservation
- ✅ Inherently supports goal hierarchy through structured information
- ❌ Minor: Light goal context where relevant

## 🎯 **PRIORITY 3: CROSS-REFERENCES**

### **File Path Updates Needed**
- `_floatprompt-compile-order.md` → Update goals.md path references
- `_floatprompt-template.md` → Already updated ✅
- All `spec-*.md` files → May reference old file names

### **Natural Goal Integration**
- Components serve goals through their natural function (avoid forced statements)
- Light goal context where contextually meaningful
- STOP fields use Strategic Guidance format where appropriate

---

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (High Impact, Low Effort)**
1. ✅ Fixed mode-specific STOP examples (avoided rigidity)
2. Update file path references in `_floatprompt-compile-order.md`
3. Light goal context in compile order where natural

### **Phase 2: Natural Integration (Low Impact, Low Effort)**
1. Light goal context in `spec-frontmatter.md` where helpful
2. Natural goal connections in `spec-core-modes.md` where appropriate
3. Contextual goal references in validation files where relevant

### **Phase 3: Quality Polish (Medium Impact, Low Effort)**
1. Review all files for natural goal service (avoid mechanical additions)
2. Ensure goal hierarchy is clear without being repetitive
3. Maintain flexibility while preserving foundational authority
