# 🎯 v0.4.0-alpha Goals-Aligned Precision Improvements

This update refactors the original audit findings through the lens of `goals.md`, properly prioritizing **AI precision over convenience** and aligning all improvements with the three-goal hierarchy.

## 🏆 PRIMARY GOAL Requirements (AI Precision)
*Non-negotiable improvements that eliminate interpretive ambiguity*

### Immediate Action Required
- **Version placeholder sweep**: Replace `{{VERSION}}` inconsistencies that create interpretive drift
- **Execution mode vocabulary**: Align human/AI execution vocabularies for consistent behavior

### High Priority  
- **Certification role clarity**: Eliminate `author` vs `certified_by` ambiguity
- **Triggers standardization**: Enforce consistent array format, eliminate flexibility that creates ambiguity
- **UID format standardization**: Firm standard, not "soft-standardizing"

## 🤝 SECONDARY GOAL Enhancements (Zero-Drift Collaboration)
*Improvements that formalize behavioral contracts*

- **Extract recommendation framework**: Formalize implicit "map→extract" pattern
- **Certification governance**: Plan locked flag transitions for system integrity
- **Timestamp field documentation**: Clarify execution vs versioning timestamps

## 🧠 TERTIARY GOAL Considerations (Intelligence Preservation)
*Optimizations within primary goal constraints*

- **Voice preservation validation**: Confirm redundancy strengthens rather than burdens
- **Scaffolding documentation**: Preserve architectural intent of dormant fields
- **Intent field monitoring**: Watch for scope creep, plan refinement if needed

## ❌ Deprioritized Items
*Original suggestions that don't serve AI precision*

- **Contributor policy surfacing**: External convenience doesn't serve primary goal
- **Relationship linking preferences**: Implementation details, not precision requirements

---

> **Goals Alignment Applied**: Every suggestion reclassified using "When in doubt: Choose AI precision over human convenience" principle. Primary goal requirements are non-negotiable, secondary goal enhancements support zero-drift collaboration, tertiary considerations optimize within established constraints.
