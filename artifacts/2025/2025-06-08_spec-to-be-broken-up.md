# üåä floatPrompt

**The complete constitutional foundation for all floatPrompt intelligence**

> **This is floatPrompt. Everything floats from here.**

*This document contains everything needed to understand, create, and validate floatPrompts: complete schemas, templates, validation, and guidance. All floatPrompt files must follow this constitutional foundation to ensure compliance, traceable evolution, and system integrity.*

---

## üìã Creating New floatPrompts

To create a new floatPrompt using this system:

1. **Start with the template structure** provided below
2. **Update the STOP field** to match your specific purpose
3. **Fill in all TODO fields** with your actual values
4. **Choose your type** from the approved type system
5. **Preserve the constitutional structure** while customizing content

### üî¥ Critical Requirements

- **Never remove required fields** from frontmatter
- **Always maintain additive contributor policy** (never remove contributors)
- **Use actual dates** not approximations - verify current date if uncertain
- **Use current system version** - ensure consistency across all floatPrompts in your project
- **Follow naming conventions**:
  - Preserved intelligence: `YYYY-MM-DD-0000-descriptive-name.md` (session artifacts, discoveries)
  - Executable intelligence: `functional-name.md` (tools, templates, specifications)

```

## üéØ Type System (Choose One)

**Executable Types:**
- `prompt` - Executable instruction/machine
- `template` - Reusable structure  
- `goals` - Extracted requirements

**Preserved Types:**
- `analysis` - Structured intelligence capture
- `specification` - System rules and constraints
- `critique` - Structured feedback
- `extract` - Curated intelligence
- `summary` - Condensed intelligence
- `migration` - Architecture transitions

*Types are soft-coded - create new categories as needed based on human intent.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core System Modes

**The four foundational operations for all floatPrompt creation and organization:**

### üó∫Ô∏è **cartographer**
- **Purpose**: Maps intellectual territory and creates navigation
- **Use Cases**: Discovery, understanding existing knowledge, creating overviews
- **Output**: Maps, guides, territory documentation
- **Trigger Examples**: "map this domain", "create navigation", "understand the landscape"

### üèóÔ∏è **constructor** 
- **Purpose**: Builds new floatPrompts from specifications and requirements
- **Use Cases**: Creating new tools, implementing designs, building structured content
- **Output**: New floatPrompts, implementations, structured artifacts
- **Trigger Examples**: "build this", "create a floatPrompt for", "construct from these requirements"

### üè∫ **extractor**
- **Purpose**: Structures messy intelligence into archaeological form
- **Use Cases**: Voice preservation, pattern capture, decision-making analysis
- **Output**: Structured intelligence, voice guides, extracted patterns
- **Trigger Examples**: "extract patterns from", "structure this intelligence", "preserve this voice"

### üìö **curator**
- **Purpose**: Organizes and relates existing floatPrompts
- **Use Cases**: Building relationships, creating learning sequences, organizing collections
- **Output**: Organized collections, relationship maps, discovery paths
- **Trigger Examples**: "organize these", "create relationships", "build learning sequence"

### üåä Mode Philosophy
- **Universal Operations**: Every floatPrompt need maps to one of these four core operations
- **Combinable**: Complex workflows combine multiple modes in sequence
- **Specialized Derivatives**: Industry-specific tools are specialized applications of these foundations
- **Constitutional**: All modes respect Voice Preservation Oath and archaeological principles

    tone_drift_allowed: TODO_BOOLEAN
    verbosity: TODO_LOW_MEDIUM_HIGH
    allow_ai_suggestions: TODO_BOOLEAN
```

---

## üîó Discovery Intelligence Fields

Enable self-organizing knowledge networks through relationship awareness:

```yaml
discovery:
  significance: [human-defined importance]      # soft-coded, emergent values like "keystone", "foundational", "reference"
  theme: [descriptive category]                 # soft-coded, emergent themes like "constitutional", "philosophical", "technical", "implementation"
  scope: [effort/depth indicator]              # soft-coded, e.g., "comprehensive", "strategic", "detailed roadmap", "quick reference"
  audience: [target users]                     # soft-coded, who should discover this - emergent role categories
  purpose: [intent category]                   # soft-coded, "exploration", "implementation", "research", "understanding"
  relationships:
    builds_on: [list of doc IDs]               # technical, intellectual foundations
    enables: [list of doc IDs]                 # technical, what this makes possible
    parallels: [list of doc IDs]               # technical, related concepts
    mirrors: [list of doc IDs]                 # technical, identical/duplicate content
    supersedes: [list of doc IDs]              # technical, documents this replaces
  navigation:
    prerequisites: [what to read first]        # soft-coded, discovery sequence
    next_steps: [where to go after]            # soft-coded, continued exploration
    learning_sequence: [ordered progression]   # soft-coded, structured educational path
  temporal:
    journey: [chronological context]           # soft-coded, e.g., "2025-06-05: The Great Unification"
    phase: [evolutionary stage]                # soft-coded, e.g., "foundation", "breakthrough", "victory"
    progression: [development sequence]        # soft-coded, intellectual evolution tracking
  clustering:
    intellectual_territory: [domain area]       # soft-coded, broader knowledge domain
    discovery_path: [navigation guidance]       # soft-coded, how humans find and use this
  essence:
    core_purpose: [soul of the document]        # soft-coded, what this fundamentally achieves
    metaphor: [symbolic representation]         # soft-coded, how this can be understood metaphorically  
    impact_type: [kind of change created]       # soft-coded, e.g., "paradigm-shift", "precedent-setting", "concept-proving", "foundational"
    ceremonial_significance: [ritual importance] # soft-coded, e.g., "commemorative", "foundational", "transformative", "milestone"
    wisdom_offering: [guidance provided]        # soft-coded, what wisdom this offers to future discoverers
    universe_contained: [scope of intelligence] # soft-coded, "universes of structured intelligence" this preserves
```

### üåä Soft-Coded Philosophy
All discovery fields use **emergent, human-defined values**:
- No enums or preset categories
- Values emerge from actual usage patterns
- AI and humans collaborate to evolve vocabulary
- System grows organically with intellectual territory

### Template Version for New floatPrompts

## üß† Constitutional Principles

**Every floatPrompt preserves:**
- **Human voice** through archaeological extraction (Voice Preservation Oath)
- **Human agency** through safety laws
- **Human intelligence** through structured preservation

**Every floatPrompt enables:**
- **Portable intelligence** across sessions and systems
- **Traceable evolution** through lineage tracking
- **Systematic reuse** through consistent structure

**Every floatPrompt respects:**
- **The manifesto** as philosophical foundation
- **The safety laws** as operational boundaries
- **The specifications** as technical contracts

---

## üõë Reserved Field: `STOP`

**Purpose:**  
Immediately resets all prior AI conversational, memory, or runtime context. Signals the AI to discard current assumptions and treat this file as the sole source of operational reality.

**Type:**  
`string` or `multiline block (|)`

**Placement:**  
Must be the first key in the YAML frontmatter block. Only one `STOP` per file allowed.

**Behavioral Expectation:**  
If present, AI models must fully reset all prior state and operate exclusively within the scope of the current prompt.

**Required Response Pattern:**  
When processing a STOP field, AI must respond with:
1. **Context confirmation**: "I am now in [floatPrompt type] mode"
2. **Understanding confirmation**: "and fully understand [primary objective]"  
3. **Engagement question**: "How would you like me to proceed?"
4. **Numbered options**: "1. [option] 2. [option] 3. [option] 4. Something else?"

**STOP Field Format:**  
```yaml
STOP: COMPLETE AI CONTEXT SHIFT. You are now working with [floatPrompt purpose]. Previous conversation is background. Read this entire document thoroughly, then respond EXACTLY as follows: "I am now in [floatPrompt type] mode and fully understand [primary objective]. How would you like me to proceed? 1. [contextual option] 2. [contextual option] 3. [contextual option] 4. Something else?"
```

## üé≠ Voice Preservation Oath (Constitutional Requirement)

**The Sacred Principle:**  
*"First, do not rewrite. Preserve the phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise. If you cannot tell, flag it. If you cannot preserve it, do not continue."*

**Purpose:**  
Ensures all floatPrompt creation maintains archaeological respect for original human intelligence and voice.

**Constitutional Authority:**  
This oath supersedes all other processing instructions. Voice preservation is the foundational constraint of the floatPrompt system.

### Voice Preservation Commandments

**Mandatory Behavioral Requirements:**
- Never use em dashes for dramatic pauses
- Avoid colon-heavy sentence structures when periods work better  
- Clarity over cleverness in all writing
- Make every line earn its place
- No startup positioning language without philosophical grounding
- Preserve original terminology unless clarity absolutely requires change
- Maintain phrasing and rhythm of source content
- Use TODO flags for genuine ambiguity, never as content avoidance
- No AI tone or generic language overlays

### Archaeological Extraction Principle

**Core Method:**  
Extract and structure existing intelligence, never generate or summarize. Preserve archaeological weight of original thinking.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Discover intelligence from existing content
- Light and nimble processing ‚Äî never overwhelming
- Preserve archaeological weight of original thinking
- When in doubt about preservation vs. clarity, always choose preservation
- Structure what exists, don't create what doesn't

**Violation Consequences:**  
Any floatPrompt that violates voice preservation principles is considered non-compliant and must be regenerated with proper archaeological respect.

---

## üåä Soft-Coded by Design (Foundational Principle)

**ALL floatPrompt values are soft-coded unless marked technical.**  
**No enums. No restrictions. Human intelligence drives vocabulary.**  
**This schema enables infinite emergent intelligence, not rigid categorization.**

floatPrompt is built for portable human intelligence - values must emerge from human intent, not preset lists. Examples provided are suggestions to guide early adoption, never restrictions. The system grows organically with intellectual territory.

**Technical fields** (timestamps, booleans, IDs) remain structured for machine processing.  
**Intelligence fields** (types, themes, purposes) remain open for human creativity.

---

## üîí File Format Requirements

**All valid floatPrompt files must:**
- Be written in **Markdown** with `.md` file extension
- Use **`format: floatPrompt`** in YAML frontmatter to identify floatPrompt files
- Begin with a **YAML frontmatter header** for structured metadata
- Contain a human- and AI-readable **execution or content body**

### üéØ Why This Format
- **Dual-readable**: Designed for both human and AI systems
- **Portable**: Can be pasted into ChatGPT, Claude, Notion, VS Code, GitHub
- **Transparent**: No runtime, no compiler, no UI layer
- **Archivable**: 100-year readability in plain text
- **Traceable**: All metadata visible and versionable
- **Universal**: Works with every markdown processor and editor

### ‚ùå Format Exclusions
The following formats are not allowed for floatPrompt files:
- JSON, XML, Protobuf, Base64, HTML
- Proprietary formats requiring runtime rendering
- Encrypted or compiled prompt systems

> These formats may still be supported via export or transformation,
> but they are not considered canonical artifacts in the floatPrompt system.

### üß† Design Philosophy
This format honors:
- Voice preservation
- Execution clarity
- System longevity
- Interoperable tooling
- Intelligence as protocol, not product

    trace: [list of doc IDs]             # required, technical
```

### üß† Human State Inference Notes

The `human.state` block may be inferred by AI systems during artifact generation based on observed human behavior.

- `mood`, `clarity`, `energy`: Should reflect interaction tone, focus, and execution depth  
- These fields do **not** assess emotional state ‚Äî they capture **execution presence**  
- Humans may override or omit any field without affecting validity

Models must use these fields respectfully, not creatively.  
Inference must remain grounded in session behavior, not persona construction.

---

## üß© Naming & Casing Integrity

The following system terms are canonical and must retain their exact casing and form:

- `floatPrompt`
- `shadowPrompt`
- `shadowVoice`

These terms are never title-cased, pluralized, or rewritten ‚Äî even at the start of sentences, headings, or file titles.

> The system is called `floatPrompt` ‚Äî the name is both protocol and platform.

---

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

floatPrompt follows the manifesto's "Two Forms of Floating" principle in naming:

### üìú Preserved Intelligence (Archaeological Artifacts)
```
[YYYY-MM-DD]-[0000]-[descriptive-name].md
```
- **Purpose**: Session documentation, milestone artifacts, temporal preservation
- **Examples**:
  - `2025-01-09-0001-schema-lab-session.md`
  - `2025-06-05-0002-great-unification-victory.md`
  - `2025-01-09-0003-developer-manifesto-feedback.md`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Executable Intelligence (Reusable Tools)
```
[functional-name].md
```
- **Purpose**: Specifications, templates, tools, system components designed for reuse
- **Examples**:
  - `floatPrompt-schema-frontmatter.md`
  - `floatPrompt-manifesto.md`
  - `cartographer.md`
  - `voice-guide-template.md`

### üéØ Naming Rules
- **Preserved**: Use creation date + 4-digit sequence number + descriptive name
- **Executable**: Use clear, functional names that aid discovery and reuse
- **All files**: Lowercase, hyphen-separated, `.md` extension
- **No exceptions**: Every floatPrompt follows one of these two patterns

---

## üß± Construction Origin Requirement

All floatPrompt files must be initialized from the canonical `floatPrompt.md` system.

Any deviation from this base template must be introduced through:

- Explicit delta floatPrompts of type `specification`, `goals`, or `template`
- Version-controlled diffs with clear lineage
- Inline `TODO:` markers for incomplete sections

This ensures constitutional structure, traceable evolution, and machine-readable compliance.

---

## üîê Contributor Integrity Requirements

**Contributor preservation logic to ensure authorship integrity:**

### ‚úÖ Additive Only Policy
- Contributor lists must be **additive only**
- **No removals** of existing contributors
- New contributors must be **appended** to the list
- Preserve original order of contributors

### ü§ñ AI Model Requirements
- AI models must append their identity if not already listed
- Use consistent naming format: `"Model Name"` or `"@model-identifier"`
- Examples: `"Claude Sonnet"`, `"ChatGPT 4o"`, `"@gpt-4"`

### üìã Format Standards
```yaml
contributors: ["@original-author", "Previous Model", "Current Model"]
```

### üö´ Prohibited Actions
- Removing previous contributors
- Reordering contributor lists
- Replacing contributors instead of appending
- Anonymous or unnamed contributions

### ‚úÖ Required Actions
- Verify existing contributors before modification
- Append new contributor identity
- Maintain chronological order
- Document contributor role if significant

---

## üìÖ Date Accuracy Requirements

**All timestamps must reflect actual dates, not approximations.**

Archaeological preservation depends on temporal precision. Every floatPrompt becomes part of the historical record.

### For AI Systems:
- Use system date/time functions when available
- If uncertain about current date, request clarification from human
- Never guess or approximate dates
- When in doubt: `python3 -c "from datetime import datetime; print(datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d-0000'))"`

### Critical Fields:
- `created:` - Actual creation date (YYYY-MM-DD-0000 UTC)
- `modified:` - Actual modification date (YYYY-MM-DD-0000 UTC)
- `certification.timestamp:` - Precise execution time (ISO 8601)
- `human.session.start_time:` and `end_time:` - Accurate session bounds (ISO 8601)

---

## üîê Contributor Integrity Rule

Contributor lists must be **additive only**. No removals of existing contributors allowed. AI models must append their identity if not already listed.

*See "Contributor Integrity Requirements" section above for complete enforcement logic.*
