        FloatPrompt allows external voice guides to override system-level defaults.
        Use a single optional field in YAML frontmatter:
        ```yaml
        voice_override: "support/voice/my-voice.fp"  # optional
        ```
        **Behavior:** If file exists and loads successfully, use it. If file missing or fails to load, gracefully fall back to system voice defaults. No configuration complexity required.

# ‚úÖ Simple Voice Preservation Override

This update defines core voice preservation rules and adds a simple override port for custom voice injection.

Single optional field. Graceful fallback. No configuration complexity.

> **Voice is structure, rhythm, and cognitive cadence. This patch protects it simply.**

## üéØ Why Simple Right Now

**Real Usage Patterns:**

- Most floatprompts will use system voice defaults
- Personal/small team use cases don‚Äôt need complex dependency management
- Voice override is experimental - start minimal, add complexity when proven necessary

**YAGNI Principle Applied:**

- Don‚Äôt solve theoretical edge cases preemptively
- Complex fallback strategies, error handling modes, and cascade logic aren‚Äôt needed yet
- Can upgrade the voice port later when real usage demands more sophistication

**Engineering Clarity:**

- Single field is easier to understand, implement, and debug
- Predictable behavior: works or falls back gracefully
- No configuration decisions required from users
- Clear success/failure path

**Growth-Ready Architecture:**

- Simple foundation supports future enhancement
- Can add complexity when actual problems arise
- Doesn‚Äôt lock into over-engineered system
- Easy to upgrade without breaking existing usage

## üß± Simple Voice Architecture

**One field, clear behavior:**

```yaml
voice_override: "support/voice/my-voice.fp"  # optional
```

**Implementation logic:**

1. Check if `voice_override` field exists
2. If yes, attempt to load specified voice guide
3. If loads successfully ‚Üí use custom voice rules
4. If missing or fails ‚Üí gracefully use system voice defaults
5. No error messages, no complex strategies, no configuration overhead

**That‚Äôs it.**

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Not Complex Fallback

**Avoided complexity that isn‚Äôt needed yet:**

- Multiple fallback strategies (graceful/strict/cascade)
- Error handling configuration options
- Dependency resolution protocols
- Validation rules for voice conflicts
- Cascade ordering and precedence logic

**These can be added later if real usage reveals they‚Äôre necessary.**

Right now, they‚Äôre solving tomorrow‚Äôs problems today.

## üß≠ Simple Wins

**This approach:**

- Enables voice customization immediately
- Maintains system reliability through graceful fallback
- Avoids configuration complexity for 90% of use cases
- Preserves ability to add sophistication when needed
- Follows good engineering principles: start simple, evolve based on real usage

**Perfect for current FloatPrompt maturity level.**
