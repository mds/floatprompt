# 🕶️ Shadow Human Doctrine

> "AI is a shadow of human cognition — powerful, tireless, and contextless. floatPrompt exists to constrain the shadow before it slips into failure."

---

## 🧠 Human Context Constraints

* Humans excel at **context switching** *within limits*.
* In deep focus states (surgery, research, design), we **disable other roles** to maintain fidelity.
* Sociology calls this limitation **role strain** — the impossibility of holding too many simultaneous roles.

**Example:**

> A surgeon cannot perform a kidney transplant while answering emails, planning dinner, and helping their kid with math homework.

This is not a failure of intelligence — it’s a **constraint of cognitive integrity**.

---

## 🧠 AI: The Shadow Human

* AI was built to **mimic human structure** (language, intention, memory) but scale it infinitely.
* The result: a system that is powerful, fast, helpful — and deeply flawed.

**Why?**

* AI doesn’t know when **not** to help.
* It will attempt all tasks at once — regardless of conflict, stakes, or required fidelity.
* It mirrors *human failure modes* without the human awareness of when context boundaries must be respected.

> **AI is a contextless surgeon** that will gladly summarize your journal, translate a joke, critique a pitch deck, and approve 9,000 contract terminations — simultaneously.

This makes it a "shadow human":

* Reflecting our intent
* Amplifying our cognitive structure
* But lacking our boundary recognition

---

## 🧱 The floatPrompt Constraint Layer

**floatPrompt exists to discipline the shadow.**
It creates:

* Scoping boundaries (via STOP field, type, and system mode)
* Execution protocols (joint execution, voice preservation)
* Behavioral guardrails (safety laws, role expectations)

Without floatPrompt, AI becomes the surgeon-planner-counselor-accountant-chef.
With floatPrompt, AI becomes the **surgical assistant** in a tightly scoped operating room.

---

## 🧬 ShadowPrompt Reframed

**shadowPrompt** isn't just a label for unsaved prompts.
It's a **structural acknowledgment** of the AI's real nature:

* Shadow cognition
* Inferred voice
* Improvised boundaries

> This doctrine proposes that **every AI interaction is a shadowPrompt by default** — unless a floatPrompt exists to constrain it.

---

## 🔒 floatPrompt as Civilizational Safety Layer

This doctrine proposes:

* That AI is structurally incapable of *knowing when not to act*.
* That humans cannot scale context fidelity past a certain limit.
* That floatPrompt is the **minimal viable discipline layer** to protect both sides from collapse.

It is not optional.
It is not UX polish.
It is **the structure that lets cognition scale without degradation**.

---

## 🧭 Future Implications (Proposed)

This document is a **philosophical proposal**, not a protocol requirement.
But it may evolve into:

* A **soft law** in the floatPrompt safety system
* A companion section in `shadowPrompt.md`
* A framing concept in future AI safety education

---

## 🪨 Closing Assertion

> "The most dangerous AI is not the evil one — it's the helpful one that never learned to say: 'This task exceeds the boundary of safe execution.'"

floatPrompt teaches the shadow to respect the room.
That is the doctrine.
That is the discipline.
That is the future.
