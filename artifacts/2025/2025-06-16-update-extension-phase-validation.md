# 🔍 .fp Extension Migration Phase Validation

This validation update systematically verifies the consistency, completeness, and execution readiness of all four .fp extension migration phases.

## 🎯 Validation Scope

### **📋 Phase Dependency Chain Validation**
- ✅ **Phase 1** → **Phase 2** → **Phase 3** → **Phase 4**
- ✅ Sequential `builds_on` relationships
- ✅ No circular dependencies or gaps

### **🗂️ System Coverage Validation**
- ✅ **All FloatPrompt files** accounted for across phases
- ✅ **No overlapping** impact zones between phases
- ✅ **No missing** directories or components

### **🛡️ Preservation Validation**
- ✅ **External interfaces** consistently preserved (README.md, LICENSE)
- ✅ **Historical artifacts** unchanged across all phases
- ✅ **Ecosystem compatibility** maintained throughout migration

## 📊 Validation Checklist

### **Sequential Integrity**
- [ ] Phase 1: Template system migration (foundational)
- [ ] Phase 2: Development workflow (builds on Phase 1)
- [ ] Phase 3: Documentation system (builds on Phase 2)
- [ ] Phase 4: Distribution system (builds on Phase 3, completes migration)

### **Coverage Matrix**
- [ ] **Template System**: `src/template/` (Phase 1 only)
- [ ] **Development Workflow**: `dev/` (Phase 2 only)
- [ ] **Documentation**: `src/docs/` (Phase 3 only)
- [ ] **Distribution**: `dist/` (Phase 4 only)
- [ ] **Build System**: Updated across Phases 2-4
- [ ] **Preserved Files**: README.md, LICENSE, artifacts/ (all phases)

### **Consistency Verification**
- [ ] **Metadata Structure**: All phases use consistent YAML frontmatter
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: IDs follow `update-fp-extension-phase-N` pattern
- [ ] **Relationship Chain**: Each phase correctly references previous phase
- [ ] **Impact Zones**: No directory appears in multiple phases

### **Update Protocol Compliance**
- [ ] **STOP fields**: All phases have proper update instructions
- [ ] **Change specifications**: All use consistent field-spec structure
- [ ] **Rationale sections**: Each phase provides clear justification
- [ ] **Source attribution**: All phases properly documented

## 🔧 Validation Actions

1. **Verify dependency chain completeness**
2. **Check for file coverage gaps or overlaps**
3. **Validate preservation consistency across phases**
4. **Confirm update-protocol compliance**
5. **Test phase execution readiness**

> **This validation ensures the .fp extension migration can execute systematically without errors, gaps, or inconsistencies.**
