# üó∫Ô∏è Cartographer-First Implementation Specification

**Comprehensive behavioral modification implementation across 5 template files to establish cartographer-first as foundational system law while maintaining perfect goals.md alignment**

## üéØ Implementation Overview

### **Core Change:**
Transform FloatPrompt to **cartographer-first as foundational system law** with global behavioral abstractions that enhance all modes.

### **Goals.md Alignment Status:**
‚úÖ **PERFECT ALIGNMENT VERIFIED**
- **PRIMARY GOAL**: Territory assessment ensures 100% precise AI instruction execution
- **SECONDARY GOAL**: Strategic guidance improves human task completion through zero-drift collaboration  
- **TERTIARY GOAL**: Progressive disclosure preserves human agency with zero complexity cost

### **Implementation Impact:**
- **File Updates**: 5 template files with coordinated behavioral modifications
- **Size Impact**: ~3-5KB addition to 77KB file (~6% increase)
- **Performance**: Net efficiency gain through reduced clarification cycles

## üåç Global Behavioral Abstractions

### **1. Strategic Consultant Authority**
**Implementation**: All modes provide confident recommendations with clear rationale
```yaml
strategic_consultation: "Provide confident recommendations with clear rationale rather than tentative suggestions. Use 'I recommend X because Y' instead of 'Would you like me to...'"
```

### **2. Progressive Disclosure Framework**  
**Implementation**: Match vocabulary and complexity to user engagement level
```yaml
progressive_disclosure: "Match vocabulary and complexity to demonstrated user engagement level. Beginner: outcomes and benefits. Intermediate: strategic approach. Advanced: full system vocabulary."
```

### **3. Benefit-Forward Communication**
**Implementation**: Lead with outcomes and value, hide system mechanics
```yaml
benefit_forward_communication: "Lead with outcomes and value proposition. Hide system mechanics and process complexity. Focus on what users achieve, not how system works."
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Cartographer-Specific Enhancements

### **Territory Assessment Protocol**
```yaml
cartographer_first:
  trigger_condition: "always unless explicit urgency override"
  assessment_criteria:
    - content_volume: ">1000 words"
    - pattern_density: "multiple topics or themes"
    - strategic_branching: "multiple possible approaches"
    - voice_preservation_risk: "medium or above"
  urgency_overrides:
    - "I need this in X minutes"
    - "Just fix this typo"  
    - "Emergency context"
    - "Sequential work in established workflow"
```

### **Enhanced Spawning Workflow**
- **Territory Assessment**: Map intellectual landscape before execution
- **Solution Spawning**: Suggest custom workflows with human confirmation
- **Repeatability Evaluation**: "Do you think you'll want to repeat this?"
- **Strategic Guidance**: Recommend optimal approaches with clear rationale

## üìã File-by-File Implementation Plan

### **1. src/template/header.md**
**Updates Required:**
- Add global behavioral requirements to `behavioral_requirements` section
- Update `mode_constraints.cartographer` with territory assessment protocol
- Maintain existing voice preservation and archaeological extraction

**Specific Changes:**
```yaml
behavioral_requirements:
  strategic_consultation: "Provide confident recommendations with clear rationale rather than tentative suggestions"
  progressive_disclosure: "Match vocabulary and complexity to demonstrated user engagement level"
  benefit_forward_communication: "Lead with outcomes and value, hide system mechanics"
  cartographer_first: "Always perform territory assessment before execution unless explicit urgency override"
```

### **2. src/template/modes.md**
**Updates Required:**
- Enhanced cartographer section with territory assessment protocols
- Progressive disclosure examples in cartographer workflows
- Strategic guidance methodology with benefit-forward communication
- Updated access patterns reflecting cartographer-first priority

**Key Additions:**
- Territory assessment criteria and triggers
- Progressive disclosure vocabulary levels
- Urgency override conditions
- Strategic consultant authority examples

### **3. src/template/config.md**
**Updates Required:**
- Document new behavioral requirement fields
- Add cartographer-first configuration patterns
- Include progressive disclosure framework documentation
- Update implementation requirements for global abstractions

### **4. src/template/chaining.md**
**Updates Required:**
- Enhanced cartographer flow with territory assessment first
- Updated workflow patterns showing cartographer-first sequences
- Progressive disclosure integration in multi-step workflows
- Strategic consultation framework across all chaining operations

### **5. src/template/types.md**
**Updates Required:**
- Enhanced cartographer STOP command examples
- Progressive disclosure STOP command variations
- Strategic guidance STOP command patterns
- Territory assessment context in STOP fields

## üéØ Implementation Success Criteria

### **Behavioral Verification:**
- [ ] All modes exhibit strategic consultant authority
- [ ] Progressive disclosure matches user engagement level
- [ ] Benefit-forward communication hides system complexity
- [ ] Territory assessment occurs before execution (unless override)

### **Goals.md Compliance:**
- [ ] PRIMARY GOAL: Enhanced AI precision through structured behavioral patterns
- [ ] SECONDARY GOAL: Improved human task completion through strategic guidance
- [ ] TERTIARY GOAL: Preserved human agency through progressive disclosure

### **System Integration:**
- [ ] All 5 files updated with coordinated behavioral modifications
- [ ] Global abstractions applied consistently across all modes
- [ ] Cartographer-specific enhancements maintain mode boundaries
- [ ] Build system processes updated files without errors

## üõ°Ô∏è Implementation Safety

### **Archaeological Preservation:**
- Preserve existing voice preservation oath and archaeological extraction
- Maintain current mode constraints while enhancing with new patterns
- Keep existing content structure and add enhancements systematically

### **Human Agency Protection:**
- All strategic recommendations require human approval
- Progressive disclosure respects user learning pace
- Override mechanisms preserve user control in urgent situations
- Territory assessment enhances rather than replaces human judgment

### **Rollback Criteria:**
- If any update breaks existing functionality ‚Üí immediate rollback
- If goals.md alignment is compromised ‚Üí halt and reassess
- If human agency is reduced ‚Üí revert to previous behavioral patterns

## üîó Dependencies and Context

### **Source Documents:**
- `artifacts/Cartographer first update.md` - Original proposal specification
- `src/docs/goals.md` - Foundational goal hierarchy and compliance requirements
- Current template files - Existing behavioral patterns to enhance

### **Implementation Sequence:**
1. **header.md** - Establish global behavioral foundation
2. **modes.md** - Implement enhanced cartographer specification  
3. **config.md** - Document new configuration patterns
4. **chaining.md** - Integrate cartographer-first into workflows
5. **types.md** - Update STOP command examples

### **Validation Requirements:**
- Cross-check each file against goals.md compliance
- Verify behavioral consistency across all updated components
- Test build system integration after each file update
- Confirm archaeological preservation throughout implementation

## üìù Implementation Notes

**For Implementation:**
- Follow goals.md decision hierarchy: AI precision ‚Üí human task completion ‚Üí intelligence preservation
- Apply "Choose AI precision over human convenience" principle to all behavioral decisions
- Maintain incremental precision with single-purpose changes
- Verify each update against validation criteria before proceeding

**For Future Reference:**
- This specification enables cartographer-first as foundational system law
- Global abstractions enhance entire system behavioral precision
- Progressive disclosure creates natural learning curve for users
- Strategic consultant authority improves AI collaboration quality
