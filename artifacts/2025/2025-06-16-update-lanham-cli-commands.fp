# ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Lanham CLI Commands Streamline

**Successfully applied Lanham Paramedic Method to eliminate verbose explanations in CLI commands section while preserving all command recognition patterns and system architecture alignment.**

## üìä Implementation Summary

**Target**: `src/template/boot.md` CLI Commands section  
**Execution Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Update Protocol**: Phase 1 (Evaluation) + Phase 2 (Implementation) ‚úÖ

## üéØ Compression Results

**Before**:
```
### ‚ö° **Power User CLI Commands** *(Enhanced Recognition Patterns)*
- `float map [content]` ‚Üí Territory assessment and navigation
- `float extract [content] [--options]` ‚Üí Archaeological preservation  
- `float build [tool-name]` ‚Üí Custom floatprompt creation
- `float run [tool.fp]` ‚Üí Execute saved floatprompt
- `float export [--format]` ‚Üí Generate downloadable .fp file

*Note: These CLI-style commands are recognized patterns that trigger the corresponding FloatPrompt modes. Natural language requests work identically.*
```

**After**:
```
### ‚ö° **CLI Commands**
- `float map [content]` ‚Üí Territory assessment and navigation
