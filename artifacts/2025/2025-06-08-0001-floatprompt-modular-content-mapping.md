# 🏺 floatPrompt Modular Content Mapping - Archaeological Artifact

**Complete record of the systematic modularization of floatPrompt specification into 11 focused components**

> **This archaeological artifact documents the successful completion of 100% accurate content distribution with verified quality assurance**

*Historical record of the systematic transformation of a 766-line monolithic specification into 11 modular components plus unified frontmatter template, achieving perfect archaeological integrity and voice preservation.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document provides a systematic mapping of every section in `_spec-to-be-broken-up.md` to its target modular file, ensuring 100% accurate content distribution with no duplication or omission.

### 🔑 Key Principles
- Exact copy-paste preservation (no rewriting)
- Complete content coverage (nothing missed)
- Logical content placement (follows compile order)
- Archaeological respect (voice preservation)
- Systematic verification (tracked completion)

---

## 🔗 Cross-Reference Tracking

**Internal References to Update:**
- References to "this document" → update to reference appropriate modular file
- Section links → update to cross-file references
- "See above/below" → update to specific file references

**Shared Content Decisions:**
- Voice Preservation Oath appears in multiple contexts → primary in spec-voice-preservation.md, reference in frontmatter.yaml
- Type system referenced in multiple places → primary in spec-type-system.md, brief reference elsewhere
- Field definitions used throughout → primary in spec-frontmatter.md, reference elsewhere

## 🎯 Execution Strategy

1. **Systematic Processing**: Follow sequence 1-11 for spec files
2. **Exact Copy-Paste**: No rewriting or paraphrasing
3. **Track Progress**: Check off each file as completed
4. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure 100% content coverage
5. **Update References**: Fix cross-references after distribution

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance

- Maintain archaeological respect for original content
- Preserve voice and phrasing exactly as written
- No content generation or summarization
- Complete fidelity to source material
- System structure preservation
