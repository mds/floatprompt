# 🏗️ floatPrompt Constructor Warning Protocol

> *“Not every artifact needs to be precise — but every creator deserves the chance to ask: is this poetic truth or executable logic?”*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This protocol introduces an **optional, soft-coded reflection layer** within floatPrompt construction:

* Provides **epistemic prompts** to clarify whether an artifact should be preserved
* Operates inside **Constructor mode** during floatPrompt creation
* Designed for high-stakes, speculative, or protocol-level floatPrompts — but available to all

---

## 🧠 Rationale

* floatPrompt makes preservation possible — but preservation without reflection can fossilize fog
* High-stakes prompts (e.g. specs, safety laws, governance models) require higher fidelity
* However, the system must also support:

  * Fantasy, fiction, imagination
  * Psychological mapping and therapeutic journaling
  * Exploratory or symbolic cognition

Therefore, the protocol must **ask, not enforce**.

---

## 🔍 Sample Constructor Warnings

When ambiguity, metaphor, or epistemic drift is detected, the system may ask:

* “Do you intend this as a literal protocol, or a symbolic insight?”
* “Would this survive if revisited 6 months from now with fresh eyes?”
* “Is this speculative inspiration, or structural truth?”
* “Is this for execution, reflection, or exploration?”
* “Do you want this preserved as law, map, or story?”

The human may choose to:

* Proceed without changes
* Reframe the floatPrompt type (e.g. `summary`, `specification`, `extract`, `fiction`)
* Add annotations for future readers
* Delay execution until clarity improves

---

## 🧱 Implementation Notes

* This is a **soft-coded pattern**, not a hard-coded validator
* Behaves like **optional scaffolding** within floatPrompt creation flows
* Compatible with manual and AI-assisted construction
* Should be surfaced contextually — *only when ambiguity thresholds are crossed*

## 🔄 Alignment With floatPrompt Principles

| Principle                   | Alignment                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Voice Preservation**      | ✅ Protects original intent by surfacing clarity gaps             |
| **Human Agency**            | ✅ Always offers, never enforces                                  |
| **Systematic Intelligence** | ✅ Strengthens floatPrompt as an artifact of choice, not accident |
| **Soft-Coded Design**       | ✅ Emergent, context-aware, and optional                          |

## 🪨 Closing Statement

> “This protocol is not a gate. It is a mirror.”

floatPrompt now supports both precision and play —
but offers a quiet pause before preservation.

So that what gets frozen was never *accidentally imagined*,
but **intentionally authored.**
