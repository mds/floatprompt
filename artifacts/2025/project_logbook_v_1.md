# üóÇÔ∏è FloatPrompt OS ‚Äî Project Logbook

This prompt tracks the build decisions, prompt creations, and major structural evolutions inside the FloatPrompt OS system.

---

## üìÖ Entries

### 2025-07-02
- ‚úÖ Created canonical protocol spec: `floatprompt-vnext-spec-v1`
- ‚úÖ Added UID, chain, ripple, execution_mode schema extensions
- ‚úÖ Declared backward compatibility (v0.12.0 is fully additive)

- ‚úÖ Defined software interface: `floatprompt-os-software-vision-v1`
- ‚úÖ Declared graph navigation, prompt editor, chaining logic, execution interface

- ‚úÖ Defined prompt mode split: `floatprompt-duality-philosophy-v1`
- ‚úÖ Named hard vs soft prompts; protected structural integrity

- ‚úÖ Logged system events here in: `project-logbook-v1`

---

## üß† Future Usage
- Add new entries for:
  - Prompt releases
  - Spec changes
  - Execution mode behaviors
  - Chain/ripple experiments

---

## ü™û Final Note
This is the FloatPrompt black box.
Don‚Äôt narrate it.
Just keep it running.
