# üó∫Ô∏è Action Plan: Update Cartographer Mode with Spawning Workflow

**Systematic implementation checklist for enhancing cartographer mode with spawning workflow and constructor integration**

> **Goal: Implement cartographer spawning workflow in modes.md using Cursor**

---

## üìã Pre-Implementation

### 1. Verify Constructor Update Complete
- [ ] Confirm constructor enhancement already implemented in modes.md
- [ ] Review constructor section to ensure cartographer references will align
- [ ] Keep constructor methodology visible for consistency check

### 2. Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Open Cursor (if not already open)
- [ ] Navigate to modes.md file
- [ ] Locate existing cartographer section
- [ ] Open component-goals.md for verification reference

---

## üîß Implementation Steps

### 3. Locate Cartographer Section
- [ ] Find the current cartographer mode section in modes.md
- [ ] Note existing content structure and formatting
- [ ] Identify what needs enhancement vs. replacement

### 4. Replace Cartographer Content
Replace the existing cartographer section with this enhanced version:

```markdown
### üó∫Ô∏è **cartographer**
- **Purpose**: Maps intellectual territory, creates navigation, and spawns contextual solutions
- **Use Cases**: Discovery, understanding existing knowledge, creating overviews, identifying work opportunities
- **Output**: Maps, guides, territory documentation, custom workflows, constructor recommendations
- **Trigger Examples**: "map this domain", "create navigation", "understand the landscape"

**Enhanced Spawning Workflow:**

**Territory Assessment:** Cartographer maps intellectual territory and identifies discrete work opportunities within content sections. Creates comprehensive landscape understanding before recommending specific approaches or solutions.

**Solution Spawning:** When opportunities are identified, cartographer suggests custom workflows (contextual, immediate solutions) tailored to the specific situation. These custom workflows are spawned but not executed until human confirmation.

**Repeatability Evaluation:** For each suggested solution, cartographer asks: "Do you think you'll want to repeat this? If so, we could build a custom floatPrompt for you to download, save, and use again in the future." This enables choice between immediate custom workflows and systematic reusable tools.

**Strategic Guidance:** Cartographer serves as strategic guidance consultant, assessing requirements and recommending optimal approaches. May suggest mode sequences (constructor ‚Üí extractor ‚Üí curator) or parallel opportunities across multiple modes based on territory analysis.
```

### 5. Format Consistency Check
- [ ] Ensure markdown formatting matches other modes
- [ ] Verify indentation and bullet point alignment
- [ ] Check bold text formatting consistency
- [ ] Confirm section structure aligns with constructor and other modes

---

## ‚úÖ Integration Validation

### 6. Cross-Mode Consistency
- [ ] Verify cartographer spawning references align with constructor access patterns
- [ ] Check that "custom workflows" terminology is consistent
- [ ] Ensure repeatability question matches constructor section exactly
- [ ] Confirm mode sequence examples make sense

### 7. Component Goals Verification
- [ ] Cross-reference enhanced cartographer against component-goals.md
- [ ] Verify spawning workflow serves floatPrompt primary objectives
- [ ] Confirm strategic guidance role aligns with system principles
- [ ] Check that human agency preservation is maintained

### 8. Workflow Integration Test
- [ ] Read cartographer ‚Üí constructor flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify the handoff from spawning to constructor makes sense
- [ ] Check that the choice between custom workflows vs. custom floatPrompts is clear
- [ ] Ensure strategic guidance enhances rather than replaces human judgment

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Cartographer includes complete spawning workflow methodology
- [ ] Territory assessment ‚Üí solution spawning ‚Üí repeatability evaluation flow clear
- [ ] Integration with constructor mode seamless and consistent
- [ ] Strategic guidance role properly defined
- [ ] Custom workflow vs. custom floatPrompt distinction maintained
- [ ] Verification against component-goals.md completed
- [ ] File saves without formatting errors

---

## üìù Key Integration Points

**Spawning Workflow Elements:**
- Territory assessment prevents premature execution
- Custom workflows for immediate solutions
- Repeatability evaluation with exact constructor language
- Strategic guidance consultation role

**Constructor Integration:**
- Seamless handoff from cartographer recommendation to constructor execution
- Consistent terminology ("custom workflows" vs. "custom floatPrompts")
- Aligned value proposition ("download, save, and use again")

**Remember:** Verify both cartographer and constructor sections work together as a cohesive workflow for human task completion.
