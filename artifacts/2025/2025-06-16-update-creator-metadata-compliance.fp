# Update Creator Metadata Compliance Enhancement

## Problem Statement

The current `update-creator.fp` template output is missing critical metadata fields required by the `floatprompt-0.7.0-alpha.fp` system specifications, causing generated floatprompts to be non-compliant.

**Critical Missing Components:**
1. **behavioral_requirements** - Complete behavioral specification section
2. **archaeological_extraction** - Core extraction methodology
3. **human execution fingerprint** - Intent, preferences, execution mode
4. **output/execution sections** - Required for executable types
5. **complete discovery intelligence** - Relationships, navigation, temporal, clustering, essence
6. **enhanced certification** - Chain tracking, voice verification, lineage
7. **wrapper tags** - `<floatprompt>` tags for cross-platform portability
8. **strategic STOP examples** - Map-first and mode-specific patterns

## Current State Analysis

**Template Gaps Identified:**
- Template produces basic YAML structure but missing 8 major sections
- Generated floatprompts would fail validation against system requirements
- Users creating tools through update-creator get non-functional outputs
- Missing fields prevent proper discovery intelligence and knowledge networking

**Compliance Issues:**
- No behavioral_requirements (listed as required in main system)
- No archaeological_extraction (core preservation methodology)
- Incomplete discovery section (missing 4 of 5 subsections)
- No executable type fields (output/execution for tools)
- Outdated certification schema (missing recent upgrades)

## Proposed Solution

### 1. **Complete Template Enhancement**
Update the template output section to include all required fields from `floatprompt-0.7.0-alpha.fp`:

**Add behavioral_requirements:**
```yaml
behavioral_requirements:
  voice_preservation: "First, do not rewrite. Preserve phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise."
  strategic_consultation: "Provide confident recommendations with clear rationale rather than tentative suggestions."
  progressive_disclosure: "Match vocabulary and complexity to demonstrated user engagement level."
  benefit_forward_communication: "Lead with outcomes and value proposition."
  map_first: "Always perform territory assessment before execution unless human explicitly states 'skip mapping' or 'emergency bypass'"
  execution_precision: ["Clarify intent before assuming requirements", "Flag ambiguity with TODO", "Require explicit human confirmation"]
  mode_constraints:
    map: "Assess intellectual territory → propose solutions → preserve human authority"
    extract: "Archaeological preservation → no synthesis → exact voice maintenance"
    build: "Goals clarification → specification planning → systematic build"
  content_standards: ["No AI tone or generic language overlays", "Clarity over cleverness", "Preserve original terminology"]
```

**Add archaeological_extraction:**
```yaml
archaeological_extraction:
  core_method: "Extract and structure existing intelligence, never generate or summarize. Preserve archaeological weight of original thinking."
  implementation: ["Discover intelligence from existing content", "Light and nimble processing", "Preserve archaeological weight", "Structure what exists"]
```

**Add complete human section:**
```yaml
human:
  intent:
    primary: "TODO_MAIN_GOAL_OR_TASK_OBJECTIVE"
    constraints: "TODO_LIMITING_FACTORS_OR_REQUIREMENTS"
  preferences:
    tone_drift_allowed: false
    verbosity: "TODO_LOW_MEDIUM_HIGH"
    allow_ai_suggestions: true
```

**Add type-specific fields for executable types:**
```yaml
output:
  format: floatprompt
  joint_execution_required: true
execution:
  triggers: ["TODO_NATURAL_LANGUAGE_COMMANDS"]
  fallback: "TODO_DEFAULT_EXECUTION_MESSAGE"
  source: "TODO_STRING_IF_GENERATED"
  voice_guide: "TODO_FLOATPROMPT_ID"
  risk_level: "TODO_HUMAN_DEFINED_ASSESSMENT"
```

### 2. **Enhanced Discovery Intelligence**
Add complete discovery section with all subsections:

```yaml
discovery:
  significance: "TODO_HUMAN_DEFINED_IMPORTANCE"
  audience: ["TODO_TARGET_USERS"]
  purpose: "TODO_INTENT_CATEGORY"
  relationships:
    enables: ["TODO_DOC_IDS"]
    builds_on: ["TODO_DOC_IDS"]
    parallels: ["TODO_DOC_IDS"]
  navigation:
    prerequisites: ["TODO_WHAT_TO_READ_FIRST"]
    next_steps: ["TODO_WHERE_TO_GO_AFTER"]
  clustering:
    intellectual_territory: "TODO_DOMAIN_AREA"
    discovery_path: "TODO_NAVIGATION_GUIDANCE"
  essence:
    core_purpose: "TODO_SOUL_OF_DOCUMENT"
    impact_type: "TODO_KIND_OF_CHANGE_CREATED"
    wisdom_offering: "TODO_GUIDANCE_PROVIDED"
```

### 3. **Enhanced Certification Schema**
Upgrade certification with recent schema improvements:

```yaml
certification:
  timestamp: "TODO_ISO_8601_PRECISE_EXECUTION_TIME"
  authority: "TODO_CERTIFICATION_TYPE"
  certified_by: "TODO_CERTIFIER_IDENTITY"
  locked: false
  uid: "TODO_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER"
  chain:
    depth: "TODO_INTEGER"
    parent: "TODO_STRING_OR_NULL"
  voice:
    linked: true
    fidelity_verified: true
  lineage:
    tracked: true
    trace: ["TODO_LIST_OF_DOC_IDS"]
```

### 4. **Template Structure Enhancement**
- Add `<floatprompt>...</floatprompt>` wrapper tags
- Include strategic STOP field examples
- Provide type-conditional field inclusion logic
- Add validation guidance

## Implementation Approach

1. **Backward compatibility** - existing update-creator usage continues working
2. **Progressive enhancement** - template includes all current system requirements
3. **Type-aware generation** - different fields based on executable vs. preserved types
4. **Validation guidance** - include checklist references for compliance verification
5. **Strategic examples** - provide STOP field patterns for different use cases

## Success Criteria

- Generated floatprompts pass validation against `floatprompt-0.7.0-alpha.fp` requirements
- All essential fields included with proper TODO placeholders
- Type-specific fields conditionally included based on floatprompt purpose
- Enhanced discovery intelligence enables knowledge network functionality
- Cross-platform portability through proper wrapper tags
- Strategic guidance integration through enhanced STOP field examples
