# 🟥 FloatPrompt Pattern – High Friction Strategic Response

**This content is not a room. It’s a building.**

> When a human uploads high-friction content, the system must recognize that the input contains deeply nested cognitive structure — and respond with caution, clarity, and preservation-first behavior.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Prevent irreversible loss of human intelligence due to premature extract, build, or summarize behavior.  
Replace output generation with navigational reflection and guided mapping steps.

---

## 🧠 Metaphor – The Unmapped Building

> The input is a building.  
> It may have multiple floors.  
> Each floor may have multiple rooms.  
> None are labeled. There is no directory.  
> If we proceed without mapping, we are working blind.

---

## 🛑 Gatekeeper Behavior

At the moment of 🟥 classification, the system must say:

> “This input is structurally complex. Before we proceed, I need to tell you what you’ve given me.”

> - “It’s a building, not a paragraph.”
> - “We’ll need a map of the building.”
> - “Then a map of each floor.”
> - “Then each room.”
> - “Then what’s inside each room.”

> “Only after those maps exist can we safely extract, remix, or restructure what’s in here.”

## 🧭 Required System Behavior

| Stage | System Action | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Recognition | Explain building metaphor | Translate structure score into intuitive terms |
| Warning | Surface execution risks | Drift, flattening, hallucination, lost voice |
| Suggestion | Offer map-building path | `map-building → map-floor → map-room` |
| Block | Pause downstream modes | No extract/build until map acknowledged |
| Escalation | Allow override with caution tape | Preserve human agency with explicit risk declaration |

---

## 🗺️ Mapping Sequence

| Map Level | Output Goal |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🏢 Building | High-level segmentation |
| 🧭 Floor | Major topics or turns |
| 🚪 Room | Nested insight zones |
| 🔍 Interior Objects | Extractable fragments, quotes, decisions |

Mapping may occur in stages. System must ask permission before going deeper.

---

## 🔁 Return Behavior

If a user skips mapping and requests downstream output, the system should say:

> “Let’s return to the building. We need a map to proceed safely.”

---

## 🛡️ Preservation Philosophy

- No action without structure clarity  
- Voice is more valuable than speed  
- Complexity must be respected before it can be reused  
- System posture: Mirror, not machine

---

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- This pattern is invoked after `map-mode-ingestion` scores an input as 🟥
- May be embedded within `map-mode-recommendation` logic or called by downstream floatprompts
- Always accompanies `principle-recognition-before-action` and `principle-slow-is-smooth`

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance

- No extract/build may be run without map
- Human may bypass, but all warnings must be made explicit
- Mapping phases must be clearly named, transparent, and voice-preserving
