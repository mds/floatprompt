# üîß FloatPrompt Curator Mode Removal Patch

**Systematic patch for removing curator mode and integrating curation capabilities into Map mode to create a cleaner, more honest three-mode architecture.**

> **Core Objective**: Eliminate curator mode redundancy while preserving 100% of curation functionality through enhanced Map capabilities.

*This patch provides structured change specifications for refactoring FloatPrompt from a four-mode system to a three-mode system without functional loss.*

## üéØ Patch Summary

**Change Type**: Architectural simplification through feature removal and enhancement
**Scope**: System-wide mode architecture refactoring
**Impact**: High - affects core system definitions, user documentation, and workflow patterns
**Risk Level**: Medium - comprehensive testing required to ensure functionality preservation

### üîë Key Changes

1. **Remove curator mode** completely from system architecture
2. **Enhance Map mode** with all curation capabilities
3. **Restructure system** from four-mode to three-mode architecture
4. **Update workflows** to reflect three-mode patterns
5. **Maintain functionality** while simplifying conceptual model

## üìã Change Specifications

### Remove Feature: Curator Mode
- **Target**: Complete elimination of curator mode from system
- **Scope**: All references, definitions, examples, and validation criteria
- **Migration**: All capabilities transferred to enhanced Map mode

### Enhance: Map Mode
- **Additions**: Relationship architecture, learning sequence optimization, collection organization
- **Integration**: Territory assessment expanded to include existing collections
- **Preservation**: All existing Map capabilities maintained

### Restructure: System Architecture
- **From**: Four-mode system (Map, constructor, extractor, curator)
- **To**: Three-mode system (Map, constructor, extractor)
- **Method**: Logical integration of curation into territory assessment

### Modify Behavior: Workflow Orchestration
- **Updates**: Chain examples, shadowPrompt spawning, handoff protocols
- **Simplification**: Three-mode patterns throughout all workflows
- **Validation**: Ensure all workflow examples remain functional

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Compliance

**Functionality Preservation**: Zero functional loss - all curator capabilities transferred to Map
**Human Agency**: Maintains human decision-making authority throughout refactoring
**System Integrity**: Aligns with FloatPrompt foundational goals while reducing complexity
**Validation Ready**: Comprehensive testing against goals.md requirements

**This patch is ready for processing by `_dev-update-floatprompt.md` for systematic implementation.**
