# ðŸ“‹ Preserved Technical Language from floatPrompt Manifesto
**Archaeological preservation of implementation details before philosophical cleanup**

> **Purpose:** Preserve all technical schema, metadata fields, and implementation details from the manifesto before removing them to maintain philosophical focus
> **Context:** Strategic cleanup to separate philosophical vision from technical documentation
> **Value:** Ensures no technical knowledge is lost during manifesto refinement

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Preservation Context

During manifesto review, we identified technical implementation details that belong in specifications rather than philosophical documents. This floatPrompt preserves those details before removal to:

- Maintain archaeological record of technical decisions
- Enable future reference for schema documentation
- Prevent loss of implementation knowledge
- Support clean separation of philosophy vs. technical specs

---

## ðŸ“‹ Technical Schema Preserved

### **1. Metadata Field Lists**

**Line 30 - Contract Enforcement Fields:**
```
- Required metadata (`joint_execution_required`, `voice_guide`, `human_intent`)  
- Human session trace (`execution_context`, `mental_state`)  
- Signature and versioning in every floatPrompt
```

**Line 59 - Core floatPrompt Fields:**
```
- Every floatPrompt includes:  
  - `source_prompt`, `voice_guide`, `execution_mode`, `chain_depth`, `lineage`
```

### **2. Technical Implementation Terms**

**Line 91-92 - Shadow Execution Details:**
```
- Voice is inferred from session (`shadowVoice`)  
- Execution mode is marked as `shadow` for traceability
```

**Line 101 - Dynamic Voice Context:**
```
- Dynamic prompts must attach `shadowVoice` session context
```

### **3. Technical Tags and Annotations**

**Line 39 - Human Context Tagging:**
```
- May work in structured contexts (canonical floatPrompts) or dynamic collaboration (tagged `@shadow`)
```

**Line 90 - Output Tagging:**
```
- Output is still floatPrompts (.md), tagged with `@shadow`
```

**Line 192 - Improvised Prompt Tagging:**
```
- Prompts may be improvised and tagged `@shadow`
```

### **4. File System and Reference Details**

**Line 100 - Voice Guide Reference:**
```
- Canonical floatPrompts must reference `voice-guide.md`
```

**Line 184 - Workshop Tools:**
```
- Voice calibration tools (voice-guide.md)
```

**Line 110 - Protocol Loop Technical Term:**
```
1. The human thinks and initiates a `floatPrompt` request
```

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Knowledge Preserved

### **Schema Field Definitions**
- `joint_execution_required` - Contract enforcement metadata
- `voice_guide` - Voice preservation reference
- `human_intent` - Builder intention capture
- `execution_context` - Session environment tracking
- `mental_state` - Human cognitive state
- `source_prompt` - Original prompt preservation
- `execution_mode` - Canonical vs shadow tracking
- `chain_depth` - Workflow position tracking
- `lineage` - Heritage and provenance tracking

### **Technical Concepts**
- `@shadow` tagging for dynamic collaboration
- `shadowVoice` for inferred voice context
- `voice-guide.md` as canonical voice reference
- Execution mode marking for traceability
- Dynamic vs canonical floatPrompt distinction

### **File System Integration**
- `.md` extension for all floatPrompts
- Specific file naming patterns (voice-guide.md)
- Tag-based categorization system
- Reference linking for voice calibration

---

## ðŸŒŠ Strategic Context

### **Why These Were Removed**
- **Manifestos should inspire**, not document schemas
- **Technical details belong in specifications**, not philosophy
- **Cognitive overhead** from implementation details
- **Accessibility barrier** for non-technical readers

### **Why They're Preserved**
- **Archaeological value** of design decisions
- **Reference material** for specification writing
- **Implementation continuity** across versions
- **Knowledge preservation** during refactoring

### **Future Usage**
- Reference for updating technical specifications
- Schema documentation source material
- Implementation guide development
- API and validator development

## âœ… Preservation Complete

All technical language, schema fields, and implementation details from the manifesto have been archaeologically preserved in this floatPrompt. The manifesto can now be cleaned to focus purely on philosophical vision and inspirational messaging while maintaining complete technical continuity through this preserved intelligence.

**Next Step:** Remove technical details from manifesto, referencing this preservation document for future technical documentation needs.

**This preservation ensures no technical knowledge is lost while enabling the manifesto to achieve its true purpose: inspiring adoption through clear philosophical vision.**
