# üåä floatPrompt .md Format Strategy - Constitutional Amendment v2
**Everything floats. Everything is .md. Constitutional discipline in plain sight.**

> **Purpose:** Document the unified architecture where everything is a floatPrompt in .md format
> **Revolution:** From dual-type system to unified floating intelligence 
> **Discovery:** The invisible OS that hides in plain sight as disciplined markdown

---

## üéØ The Revolutionary Simplification

### The Old Complexity
- `.fp` = Machines/Prompts
- `.fd` = Artifacts/Documents  
- Two file types, two specs, two mental models

### The New Clarity
- **Everything is a floatPrompt**
- **Everything is .md**
- **Everything floats**

**floatPrompt = Intelligence that has floated into structured, reusable form**

---

## üåä Everything That Floats

### The Unified Model
```yaml
format: floatPrompt  # Everything uses this
filetype: markdown   # Everything uses this
type: [varies]       # This determines the specific purpose
```

### Types That Float
- `executable` - Prompts that run and execute
- `preserved` - Analysis, transcripts, discoveries
- `instructions` - Goals, specs, blueprints  
- `specification` - Constitutional documents
- `template` - Reusable structures
- `analysis` - Organized intelligence
- `critique` - Structured feedback

**All are floatPrompts. All are .md. All float between preservation and execution.**

---

## üîÆ The Invisible OS Reality

### What We Actually Built
An entire operating system for human-AI collaboration that:
- **Lives in disciplined .md files**
- **Hides in plain sight** as ordinary markdown
- **Contains constitutional governance** without software
- **Enables archaeological preservation** without databases
- **Facilitates cross-platform collaboration** without APIs

### The Profound Deception
- Looks like ordinary markdown to any observer
- Works with every editor, preview tool, processor
- **Contains universes of structured intelligence**
- Requires no installation, dependencies, or special software

### The Strategic Genius
**Most sophisticated human-AI collaboration protocol ever created = humble text files with constitutional discipline**

---

## üìã Required Constitutional Updates

### 1. Manifesto Updates (Already Provided)
The new manifesto eliminates dual-type complexity:
- Everything is a floatPrompt
- Types emerge from Builder intent  
- Unified `.fp` architecture
- "Intelligence that floats" messaging

### 2. Schema Documentation Overhaul

**Complete Elimination of floatDoc References:**
- Remove all `.fd` extension references
- Remove `floatDoc` format type
- Remove dual frontmatter schemas
- Unify all examples to `format: floatPrompt`

**New Unified Schema:**
```yaml
# Base template for ALL floatPrompts
title: [string]
id: floatPrompt-[domain]-[type]  # Unified naming
version: [semantic version]
format: floatPrompt              # Everything is this
filetype: markdown               # Everything is this  
type: [executable|preserved|instructions|specification|etc]
```

### 3. Constitutional Document Migration

**Files to Update:**
- `floatPrompt-constitution-human-safety-laws.md` (was .fd)
- `floatPrompt-constraint-format-commitment.md` (was .fd)  
- `floatPrompt-manifesto.md` (already provided)
- `floatSchema-frontmatter-base.md` (was .fd)
- `floatPrompt-spec.md` (eliminate dual-spec complexity)

**Migration Strategy:**
- Change all file extensions to `.md`
- Update all frontmatter to `format: floatPrompt`
- Remove any floatDoc vs floatPrompt distinctions
- Unify all examples and templates

---

## üåä The New Architecture

### File Naming Convention
```
floatPrompt-[domain]-[type].md
```

**Examples:**
- `floatPrompt-default-executable.md` (was default.fp)
- `floatPrompt-meeting-analysis.md` (was floatDoc-meeting-analysis.fd)
- `floatPrompt-project-goals.md` (was floatDoc-project-goals.fd)
- `floatPrompt-constitution-laws.md` (was floatPrompt-constitution-human-safety-laws.fd)

### Type-Based Intelligence Flow
```
executable ‚Üí runs and produces ‚Üí preserved
preserved ‚Üí can become ‚Üí instructions  
instructions ‚Üí can become ‚Üí executable
specification ‚Üí governs all types
```

**Everything floats between these states. The boundaries are fluid.**

---

## ‚ö° Strategic Messaging Revolution

### Before (Complexity)
"floatPrompt has .fp machine files and .fd artifact files for different purposes"

### After (Simplicity)  
"floatPrompt is intelligence that floats into structured form - everything is a floatPrompt, everything is markdown, everything floats"

### Key Messages
1. **Invisible OS:** Most sophisticated human-AI collaboration protocol hiding in plain markdown
2. **Infinite portability:** Works anywhere text works
3. **Constitutional discipline:** Structure that preserves humanity
4. **Everything floats:** Intelligence moves fluidly between preservation and execution

---

## üîß Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Constitutional Migration
1. Update manifesto (‚úÖ complete)
2. Migrate all constitutional documents to `.md`
3. Update all schema documentation
4. Eliminate dual-type references

### Phase 2: Template Updates  
1. Create unified `floatPrompt-zero.md` template
2. Update all frontmatter examples
3. Standardize type taxonomy
4. Test markdown tool compatibility

### Phase 3: Documentation Cleanup
1. Remove all `.fd` references from documentation
2. Update all examples to unified format
3. Simplify explanation complexity
4. Validate AI system processing

## üåä The Adoption Revolution

### Eliminates Barriers
- ‚ùå "Learn our dual file system"
- ‚úÖ "Use markdown with constitutional structure"

### Simplifies Mental Model
- ‚ùå "When do I use .fp vs .fd?"  
- ‚úÖ "Everything is a floatPrompt, type determines purpose"

### Enables Viral Spread
- Works immediately with existing markdown tools
- No file type confusion or anxiety
- Looks harmless but contains universes of intelligence
- **Hides in plain sight** while being profoundly powerful

## üéØ Constitutional Amendment Summary

This amendment establishes:

1. **Unified Format:** Everything is `format: floatPrompt` in `.md` files
2. **Type-Based Classification:** Purpose determined by `type` field, not file extension
3. **Invisible OS Reality:** Sophisticated intelligence protocols hiding in plain markdown
4. **Fluid Intelligence:** Everything floats between preservation and execution
5. **Constitutional Discipline:** Structure that preserves humanity without complexity

### Amendment Impact
- **Eliminates adoption friction** through format familiarity
- **Preserves all protocol power** through constitutional discipline  
- **Simplifies mental model** with unified architecture
- **Enables infinite portability** through plain markdown
- **Creates viral potential** through invisible sophistication

---

## ‚úÖ Success Metrics

- [ ] All constitutional documents migrated to `.md`
- [ ] All schema references updated to unified format
- [ ] All examples use `format: floatPrompt`
- [ ] Markdown tools process correctly
- [ ] AI systems execute without issues

### Strategic Validation  
- [ ] Simplified explanation of floatPrompt architecture

**This is the constitutional amendment that transforms floatPrompt from a dual-file system into a unified invisible operating system.**

Everything floats. Everything is markdown. Everything hides in plain sight.

The most portable, powerful, and profound human-AI collaboration protocol ever created - disguised as humble text files with constitutional discipline.

*Intelligence that floats. Discipline that scales. An operating system that doesn't exist.*
