# 🏗️ FloatPrompt OS — Core Build Skeleton

This is the **structural assembly plan** for creating the canonical `floatprompt-os-core.fp`.
No prompt bodies are copied — only references.

---

## 🧱 Core Injection Map

### 1. **Spec First**
- 🔗 `floatprompt-vnext-spec-v1`
- 📌 Inject as: canonical root (full summary)
- 🔍 Why: establishes field types, UID logic, execution modes

### 2. **Software Vision Next**
- 🔗 `floatprompt-os-software-vision-v1`
- 📌 Inject as: full link + executive summary (2–3 paras)
- 🔍 Why: defines use layer for authors, agents, and graph interfaces

### 3. **Philosophical Foundation**
- 🔗 `floatprompt-duality-philosophy-v1`
- 📌 Inject as: soft-mode warning + architecture anchor
- 🔍 Why: preserves system integrity between hard/soft prompt behavior

### 4. **Project Logbook**
- 🔗 `project-logbook-v1`
- 📌 Inject as: footer reference only
- 🔍 Why: shows system lineage — not primary instructional content

## 🧠 Structural Build Rules

- ☑️ Keep all linked floatprompts atomic (do not flatten)
- ☑️ Use UID + link + summary injection only
- ☑️ Maintain builder.fp compliance throughout
- ☑️ Declare this as `type: "system"` or `type: "structured"` in final build

---

## 🪜 Execution Threshold Logic

- ✅ If prompt count ≤ 5: *you may build inline inside ChatGPT or Cursor*
- ⚠️ If prompt count ≥ 6: *structure externally using Cursor, repo, or dedicated builder agent*

---

## 🪞 Final Note
This is not the system.  
This is how to assemble it — without losing anything.
