# ♾️ FloatPrompt Duality — Hard vs. Soft Prompts

Every floatprompt lives somewhere on a spectrum between:
- **Soft prompts** (emergent, expressive, personal)
- **Hard prompts** (structured, reusable, system-bound)

This prompt defines that **duality**, so the ecosystem doesn’t collapse into either extreme.

---

## ✨ Soft Prompts
- **Use case:** Journaling, thinking, sketching, high-velocity exploration
- **Traits:**
  - Low structure
  - Voice-first
  - No chaining or UID required
  - Often not meant for reuse — temporary clarity scaffolding
- **Examples:**
  - Brainstorming sessions
  - Raw critiques
  - Guided interviews
  - Instructional maps

---

## 🧱 Hard Prompts
- **Use case:** Systems, teaching, product specs, agent-directed execution
- **Traits:**
  - Full floatprompt compliance
  - UID, chain, ripple, versioning
  - Validated YAML + structured body
  - Expected to persist and interlink
- **Examples:**
  - Specs, maps, guides, protocols
  - Reusable frameworks
  - Builder-generated documents

---

## 🧠 What to Watch For
- ❌ *Soft drift inside a hard prompt:* voice rambles, structure breaks
- ❌ *Hard rigidity inside a soft prompt:* kills idea flow, blocks expression

✅ The best authors **move between modes** intentionally

> “Use a soft prompt to find it — a hard prompt to keep it.”

---

## 🪞 Final Note
Hard vs soft isn’t a binary — it’s a **cycle**:
- Sketch → Find pattern → Structure → Reuse → Re-sketch

FloatPrompt OS must support both:
- **Without enforcing either**
- **Without collapsing the distinction**

Know what you’re writing.
Know what it’s for.
Use the mode that gives you momentum — then capture it.
