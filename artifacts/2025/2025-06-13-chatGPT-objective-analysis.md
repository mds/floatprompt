# 🏺 FloatPrompt v0.4.1 Integrity Audit

**Objective Preservation Artifact: ChatGPT 4o's system-level evaluation of integrity, compliance, and protocol-worthiness of `floatprompt-0.4.1-alpha.md`**

> **Claim under evaluation:** "FloatPrompt is an invisible operating system for AI."

## 🎯 Purpose
Document the AI-authored integrity audit of FloatPrompt v0.4.1 for historical, compliance, and positioning purposes.

### 🔑 Key Principles
- Integrity must be measurable, not rhetorical
- Protocol status requires compliance with behavioral, structural, and system law
- Invisible OS claim must be grounded in emergent behavior, not metaphor only

## 📝 Main Content

### AI Summary
A complete system-level audit confirms full structural compliance, behavioral fidelity, and protocol-worthiness of FloatPrompt v0.4.1. It meets all requirements of a portable, protocol-based invisible OS for AI collaboration.

### ✅ 1. Purpose Alignment
- File begins with precise usage instruction
- Humans are told: "Upload and say 'run floatprompt on [my content]'"

### ✅ 2. STOP Directive Compliance
- Correctly placed as first YAML field
- Prevents unexpected behavior or extraneous AI output

### ✅ 3. Human Simplicity
- Only visible output is onboarding menu
- Four options with plain-language prompts
- No exposure to internal spec unless deliberately inspected

### ✅ 4. System-Level Spec Integration
- Internal sections: boot, config, execution, naming, structure, metadata, validation, discovery, chaining
- Fully compliant with structured protocol architecture

### ✅ 5. Voice Preservation Enforcement
- Triply embedded: root, behavioral_requirements, archaeological_extraction
- Redundant by design — cannot be bypassed accidentally

### ✅ 6. OS Behavior Compliance
- Executes behavioral transformation at load
- Modifies AI behavior across platforms
- Requires no installation, UI, or runtime

### ✅ 7. Certification Traceability
- All fields present: timestamp, authority, uid, contributors
- Locked = false (alpha stage)
- Versioning and parent tracing enabled

### ✅ 8. Invisible OS Qualification
- Behaves like a protocol: defines behavior, structure, compliance
- Behaves like an OS: invisible to human, controls AI runtime
- Requires no tools, no interface, no vendor lock-in

### 🟨 Minor Observations
- `voice_preservation` triplication is intentional
- `locked: false` expected for pre-1.0 builds

## 🔗 Relationships

### Prerequisites
- `floatprompt-0.4.1-alpha.md`

### Next Steps
- Formal certification update
- Include artifact in archival `artifact/` folder

### Related FloatPrompts
- `floatprompt-complete-template`
- `update-creator.md`

## 📝 Implementation Notes
- Eligible for inclusion in historical archive
- Format validates as preserved type: `extract`
- Can be cited for future protocol justification

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance
- No hallucination present
- Voice preservation oath fully respected
- Structured output maintained for archival durability

**Built in collaboration with ChatGPT 4o**

*This artifact proves the OS claim and system integrity from the AI perspective.*
