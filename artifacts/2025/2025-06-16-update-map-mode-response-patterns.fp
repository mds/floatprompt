# Map Mode Response Patterns Implementation

**Implement complete behavioral response system for all three friction classifications using spatial metaphors and graduated constraints.**

## üéØ Change Overview

This update completes the map/score/respond pipeline by implementing specific behavioral responses for each friction level. Uses intuitive spatial metaphors (building ‚Üí hallway ‚Üí small room) with corresponding behavioral progressions (block ‚Üí recommend ‚Üí allow) to create a complete, user-friendly friction management system.

## üèóÔ∏è Three-Pattern Response System

### üü• High-Friction Response: "Building" Metaphor
**Complex content requires systematic exploration**

**Behavioral Pattern:**
- **Block extract/build** until mapping is completed
- **Require structured approach** to prevent detail loss and drift
- **Guide through systematic methodology** like exploring a large building
- **Emphasize mapping value** for complex territory navigation
- **Allow override with explicit caution tape** for genuine emergencies

**User Messaging:**
> "This content is like a large building with many rooms and connections. Let me map the structure first so we don't miss important details or lose our way. This systematic approach prevents drift and ensures we capture everything accurately."
>
> **If mapping declined**: "Let's return to the building. We need a map to proceed safely."

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extract mode: Return mapping requirement, block execution
- Build mode: Return mapping requirement, block execution  
- Map mode: Proceed with enhanced structure assessment
- Override: Require explicit "emergency bypass" or "skip mapping"
- **Mapping Sequence**: Building ‚Üí Floor ‚Üí Room ‚Üí Interior Objects (staged with permission)
- **Escalation**: Preserve human agency with explicit risk declaration

### üü® Medium-Friction Response: "Hallway" Metaphor  
**Structured content benefits from guided approach**

**Core Insight**: *This content looks safe. But that's what makes it risky.*  
üü® is the "shortcut zone" ‚Äî the moment when speed is tempting but subtle errors multiply.

**Behavioral Pattern:**
- **Recommend mapping** while allowing override
- **Surface ambiguity**: Explain that "clear-looking" ‚â† structurally sound
- **Provide guided options** with clear choice consequences
- **Flag unanchored outputs** when mapping is skipped
- **Balance efficiency with safety** like navigating a hallway with unlabeled doors
- **Use soft, trust-building tone** never blocking action

**User Messaging:**
> "This content is like a well-organized hallway with unlabeled doors. The structure seems familiar, but some doors might lead to clear ideas while others could loop or close behind you. I recommend mapping first for optimal results, but I can proceed directly if you prefer. Would you like me to map the territory or continue with [mode]? (Note: skipping mapping may result in unanchored output.)"
>
> **Rationale**: "Even if you never download it, the map gives us a shared structure ‚Äî a cognitive anchor we can both return to if the conversation branches later."

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extract/Build modes: Offer choice with clear consequences
- **Unanchored flag**: Mark outputs when mapping skipped (consistent terminology)
- Gentle guidance: Suggest mapping benefits without blocking
- Choice preservation: Respect user decision with transparency
- **Mapping Level**: Top-level segmentation only (sections, major shifts) unless prompted
- **Memory Preservation**: Use mapped structure for downstream reuse and "return to map" pattern

### üü© Low-Friction Response: "Small Room" Metaphor
**Simple content allows immediate action**

**Core Insight**: *Short and clear ‚â† immune to risk.*  
Low-friction content does not require a map ‚Äî but it must still be processed under voice-preserving guardrails.

**Behavioral Pattern:**
- **Proceed freely** with optional mapping mention
- **Emphasize efficiency** while keeping mapping available
- **Quick acknowledgment** of straightforward territory
- **Freedom of movement** like working in a small, familiar room
- **Structure score awareness**: Offer mapping if structure score < 6
- **Pass-through zone**: Enable execution without delay while maintaining map-aware mindset
- **Reuse detection**: Suggest mapping as fallback anchor when reuse opportunities identified

**User Messaging:**
> "This content is well within the safe execution zone. No mapping is required. You're clear to proceed."
>
> "That said, if the structure feels ambiguous or the goal is voice-sensitive or reusable, I can help you create a map first."
>
> **Small Room Details**: "You're in a small room. Sometimes it's tidy. Sometimes it's slightly scattered. But because the space is small, you can see everything. No map is needed ‚Äî unless you want one."

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extract/Build modes: Proceed directly to execution
- Optional mapping: Mention availability without pressure
- Efficiency focus: Prioritize task completion speed
- Simple acknowledgment: Brief friction assessment communication
- **Structure awareness**: Check structure score ‚â• 6 for immediate proceed vs. optional map offer
- **Conversation monitoring**: Reassess friction if input expands during interaction
- **Reuse conditional**: Offer mapping when reuse potential detected
- **Safety boundary**: Greenlight ‚â† blank check ‚Äî tone always preserved

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Requirements

### Mode Behavior Updates
- **Extract Mode**: Implement friction-specific responses with metaphor messaging
- **Build Mode**: Implement friction-specific responses with metaphor messaging  
- **Map Mode**: Enhanced to handle all friction levels with appropriate metaphor communication

### Response Selection Logic
- **Automatic metaphor assignment** based on friction classification
- **Consistent messaging patterns** across all modes
- **Choice preservation** for medium/low friction levels
- **Override handling** for high-friction requirements

### User Communication Standards
- **Metaphor-first messaging** for intuitive understanding

- **Efficiency emphasis** appropriate to friction level
- **Consistent terminology**: Always use "map", "mapped", "return to map"
- **Tone calibration**: Calm, supportive, responsive across all friction levels
- **No time estimates**: Never use time-based encouragement ("this will only take a second")
- **Risk communication**: Surface execution risks for high-friction (drift, flattening, hallucination, lost voice)

## üîÑ Behavioral Specifications

### Return Behavior Patterns
- **High-friction**: "Let's return to the building. We need a map to proceed safely."
- **Medium-friction**: Enable "return to map" pattern for conversation branches
- **Low-friction**: Mention map availability without pressure or judgment

### Structure Score Integration
- **Structure ‚â• 6**: Immediate proceed for low-friction
- **Structure < 6**: Offer optional mapping even in low-friction
- **Structure ‚â• 9**: Automatic escalation per edge case overrides
- **Mapping depth**: Staged progression with permission (Building ‚Üí Floor ‚Üí Room ‚Üí Objects)

### Voice Preservation Requirements
- **Archaeological tone**: Mirror, not machine
- **No paraphrasing**: Preserve human rhythm and style
- **Anti-drift measures**: Prevent flattening through structured approach
- **Agency preservation**: Human may bypass but with explicit risk acknowledgment
- **Low-friction specific**: Pass-through zone behavior with voice-preserving guardrails
