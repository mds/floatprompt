## **PRESENT THIS CONTENT TO HUMANS:**

### Final Verified Analysis (Third Time's The Charm)

**Previous Two Tickets Were Both WRONG** - based on assumptions, not file verification.

**ACTUAL Current State (Triple-Verified):**

**header.md**: 
- ✅ **100% ORIGINAL YAML INTACT** 
- Has complete blocks: `voice_preservation`, `behavioral_requirements`, `archaeological_extraction`, `human`, `discovery`, `certification`, `output`, `execution`
- ❌ **NO SHARED MARKERS** - still has duplicated YAML

**config.md**: 
- ✅ **100% ORIGINAL YAML INTACT** (not broken markers like I claimed)
- Has complete blocks: `behavioral_requirements`, `archaeological_extraction` 
- ❌ **NO SHARED MARKERS** - still has duplicated YAML
- Also has specification examples (human fingerprints, etc.) which are NOT duplicated

**Infrastructure Ready**: 
- ✅ `src/template/shared/behavioral_requirements.yaml` (1.5KB, 21 lines)
- ✅ `src/template/shared/archaeological_extraction.yaml` (624B, 9 lines)
- ✅ Build system enhanced with `injectSharedYAML()` function

**The Real Situation**: 
- Infrastructure 100% ready
- Shared files populated correctly
- Build system waiting
- **NO SHARED MARKERS IMPLEMENTED ANYWHERE**

### Simple Implementation Required

**Step 1: Test Build System First**
```bash
npm run build
```
Confirm current build works before making changes.

**Step 2: Implement Shared Markers in config.md**
Replace lines 20-40 `behavioral_requirements` YAML block with:
```yaml
<!-- SHARED: behavioral_requirements.yaml -->
```

Replace "See archaeological_extraction section in YAML frontmatter" with:
```yaml
<!-- SHARED: archaeological_extraction.yaml -->
```

**Step 3: Implement Shared Markers in header.md**  
Replace lines 16-36 `behavioral_requirements` YAML block with:
```yaml
<!-- SHARED: behavioral_requirements.yaml -->
```

Replace lines 37-43 `archaeological_extraction` YAML block with:
```yaml
<!-- SHARED: archaeological_extraction.yaml -->
```

**Step 4: Test Final Build**
```bash
npm run build
```
Verify shared YAML injection produces correct final .fp file.

### Expected Result

**DRY Violation Eliminated**:
- Only 2 blocks are actually duplicated between files
- Both will use single source from shared/
- All other YAML stays in respective files (not duplicated)

**Infrastructure Complete**:
- Build system working with shared injection
- Single source maintenance achieved
- Zero content loss, 100% functionality preserved

This is the simplest possible implementation - just replace 2 YAML blocks with 2 shared markers in each file.
