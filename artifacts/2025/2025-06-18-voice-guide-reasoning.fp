# 🗃️ Full Development Transcript: Voice Guide Specification

This file captures the strategic dialogue that shaped the creation of `voice-guide-spec.fp`. It includes source discussion fragments, iterative decision logs, and cross-AI reflection spanning Claude and ChatGPT systems. This record is intentionally verbose to preserve all nuance.

---

## 🧠 Primary Problem Statement
> “I’m preparing to use floatprompt to map and extract all of my personal content into a reusable voice and tone guide... so anyone can write on my behalf with fidelity.”

This initial idea framed the intent of creating a portable MDS voice model. From there, the system evolved to serve *any* knowledge worker.

---

## 🧭 Strategy Clarification Thread
- Define what a voice-guide must contain
- Lock the spec before building a custom floatprompt
- Use the spec to guide the creation of `voice-guide-creator.fp`
- Use that floatprompt to build `voice-guide-mds.fp`

> "The goal is a universal, scalable voice preservation engine that can serve any knowledge worker—including me (MDS) as the first subject."

---

## ⚖️ Design Tradeoffs and Key Decisions

### Sliders vs Descriptive Fields
- **Sliders** handle remix flexibility (e.g. clarity, formality, technicality)
- **Descriptive fields** capture hard constraints (e.g. forbidden phrases, humor rules)

> "Use sliders when humans might want to adjust per session. Use descriptive fields for things that must never drift."

---

### Initial Calibration Heuristic
> "If it doesn’t sound like something I would naturally speak out loud, then I shouldn’t write it that way."

This became the foundation of the human validation loop.

---

### Claude Parallel Thread
- Voice archetypes, slider discovery loop, downstream adaptation all explored collaboratively
- Consensus across both models validated:
  - Live AI/human tuning loop
  - Contextual override via `voice_override`
  - Avoiding early overuse of presets

---

## 🧱 Iterative Architecture Evolution

- **Started** with high-level idea of a reusable voice file
- **Moved** to modular build format with calibration sliders
- **Extended** to emotional range, energy, and structure preferences
- **Finalized** as a constitutional document with:
  - `voice_preservation`
  - `behavioral_requirements`
  - `content_warnings`

> "This isn’t just a guide. It’s law."

---

## 📂 Versioning and Specification Notes
- v0.1.0 defined required fields, spec layout, preservation loop
- v0.2.0 introduced:
  - `voice_preservation:` YAML contract
  - `energy_level`, `emotional_range` sliders
  - `content_volume_words`, `content_contexts`, `recency`
  - `content_warnings` to guide minimum viable input material
  - `downstream_presets` as format-level guidance

> "This justifies a version bump. It goes from structural template to full behavioral contract."

---

## 📜 Calibration Loop Confirmation
- Extract → Propose → Adjust → Lock
- Always includes human-in-the-loop review
- Never locks without human fidelity confirmation

---

## 🔒 Drift Prevention Checklist
- Banned phrases
- Flattening warnings
- Forbidden structures
- Humor misfire boundaries

All were added based on AI introspection: "What would I be tempted to fill in or overhelp with if I lacked guidance?"

---

## 🧾 Closing Summary
This document serves as the historical trace of thought, constraint mapping, and architectural rigor that enabled the creation of `voice-guide-spec.fp`.

It should be preserved as an artifact of original system intent. Future changes to the voice system spec should be logged here.
