# üéØ Action Plan: Update modes.md with Constructor Enhancement

**Systematic implementation checklist for enhancing constructor mode with three-phase methodology**

> **Goal: Implement constructor three-phase methodology in modes.md using Cursor**

---

## üìã Pre-Implementation

### 1. Open Development Environment
- [ ] Open Cursor
- [ ] Navigate to floatPrompt project directory
- [ ] Open `modes.md` file
- [ ] Locate existing constructor section

### 2. Verification Setup
- [ ] Open `component-goals.md` for verification reference
- [ ] Keep both files visible for cross-validation
- [ ] Prepare to test enhancement against component goals

---

## üîß Implementation Steps

### 3. Locate Target Section
- [ ] Find the current constructor mode section in modes.md
- [ ] Identify the existing content that needs enhancement
- [ ] Note current structure for context preservation

### 4. Replace Constructor Content
Replace the existing constructor section with this enhanced version:

```markdown
### üèóÔ∏è **constructor** 
- **Purpose**: Builds new floatPrompts through systematic three-phase co-creation
- **Use Cases**: Creating specialized tools, implementing custom requirements, building domain-specific floatPrompts for download and reuse
- **Output**: Complete, immediately usable custom floatPrompts
- **Trigger Examples**: "build this", "create a floatPrompt for", "construct from these requirements"

**Three-Phase Methodology:**

**Goals Clarification:** Constructor recognizes requests for custom floatPrompt creation and uses soft-coded questioning to clarify true intent. Essential questions cover the specific problem, target users and context, success criteria, constraints, and voice preservation needs. Constructor requires explicit human confirmation before proceeding to ensure goals are crystal clear with no assumptions remaining.

**Specification Planning:** Constructor creates build plans by capturing and reflecting clarified goals back to the human in soft-coded form. The specification is simply "Here's what I understand you want to build..." followed by clear goal presentation for confirmation. Constructor knows goals are clear enough when they align with floatPrompt's primary objectives: enabling 100% precise AI instruction execution, human task completion, and voice preservation.

**Systematic Build:** Constructor builds custom floatPrompts using current floatPrompt architecture as foundation while applying specifications and maintaining core principles. Voice preservation and archaeological extraction are embedded throughout construction. Delivers complete tools ready for download, saving, and future reuse with post-deployment refinement support.

**Access Patterns:** Constructor can be invoked through cartographer recommendation when repeatability is identified, or called directly by experienced users. When cartographer identifies reusable opportunities, it asks: "Do you think you'll want to repeat this? If so, we could build a custom floatPrompt for you to download, save, and use again in the future."
```

### 5. Format Verification
- [ ] Ensure markdown formatting is consistent with other modes
- [ ] Verify indentation matches existing structure
- [ ] Check that bullet points and bold formatting align

---

## ‚úÖ Post-Implementation Validation

### 6. Component Goals Verification
- [ ] Open `component-goals.md`
- [ ] Cross-reference enhanced constructor against component goals
- [ ] Verify alignment with primary floatPrompt objectives
- [ ] Confirm three-phase methodology serves stated goals

### 7. Integration Check
- [ ] Review how constructor fits with other three modes
- [ ] Verify cartographer spawning references make sense
- [ ] Ensure mode philosophy consistency maintained

### 8. Final Review
- [ ] Read through complete modes.md file
- [ ] Verify constructor enhancement feels natural in context
- [ ] Check for any inconsistencies or formatting issues

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Constructor section includes complete three-phase methodology
- [ ] Access patterns clearly defined (cartographer + direct invocation)
- [ ] Value proposition clear ("download, save, and use again")
- [ ] Integration with existing mode structure maintained
- [ ] Verification against component-goals.md completed
- [ ] File saves without formatting errors


## Amendments to add to your modes update floatPrompt:
1. Add Strategic Assessment to Extractor Mode:

Include scope assessment capability (goal + territory ‚Üí optimal approach)
Add confident recommendation delivery rather than asking technical choices
Include granularity calibration to prevent over-atomization

2. Add Strategic Consultation Framework Section:

Strategic pause points between major phases
Purpose alignment verification throughout extraction
Systematic feedback loop mechanism for human corrections
Success validation against original human goals

3. Enhance Cartographer Mode:

Add extraction planning intelligence (when to preserve territorial map vs. hold in memory)
Include strategic spawning recommendations based on scope assessment

4. Add Quality Assurance Checkpoints:

Context load management guidelines
Structured approach to continuation vs. fresh start decisions
Granularity detection mechanisms across all modes

5. Update Success Criteria:

Add validation that modes can confidently recommend rather than defer
Include check for strategic consultation framework integration
Verify granularity collapse prevention mechanisms

These address the real-world gaps we found while keeping your original constructor focus and implementation approach.

## üìù Notes

**Key Enhancement Elements:**
- Three-phase methodology (Goals ‚Üí Spec ‚Üí Build)
- Soft-coded questioning and human confirmation gates
- Clear distinction between custom workflows vs. custom floatPrompts
- Access patterns via cartographer recommendation or direct call
- Tangible value proposition for reusable tools

**Remember:** Test the enhancement against component-goals.md to ensure alignment with floatPrompt system objectives.
