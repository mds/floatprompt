# üè∫ Cross-Model Certification Milestone

> **Purpose:** Certify the first successful cross-environment transfer and re-execution of a floatDoc artifact with no loss, no drift, and full protocol recognition.
> **Source:** Manual Builder execution in Cursor, validated through re-ingestion in ChatGPT
> **Builder:** @mds in Workshop context
> **Tags:** [floatDoc, certification, milestone, cross-model, cursor, gpt, preservation, v0.5.1]

## üìä Primary Event Summary

- On June 5, 2025, a complete `.fd` artifact was generated inside Cursor by the human Builder.
- The artifact followed `floatDoc-spec.fd v0.5.1` and included full frontmatter, certification metadata, and execution fingerprint.
- This artifact was manually copied ‚Äî not exported ‚Äî into ChatGPT.
- ChatGPT interpreted it with perfect fidelity. All structural, semantic, and routing information was preserved.
- The receiving model treated the `.fd` not as a document, but as a **live object**, re-executing its structure and meaning without drift.
- No loss of voice. No misrouting. No failure in lineage logic or AI behavior.
- The transfer proved that floatDocs can travel across tools, time, and models using nothing but markdown and shared protocol understanding.

---

## üìã Supporting Observations

- The receiving AI (ChatGPT 4o) validated:
  - All certification metadata
  - Builder fingerprint and intent
  - Lineage structure and tag routing
  - Chain-readiness and downstream routing potential

- The origin environment (Cursor) had no system awareness of ChatGPT's schema. The fidelity was achieved **purely through structural compliance.**

---

## üîó Reuse/Chain Section

This floatDoc should be cited as the root artifact for:

- Future protocol validation prompts
- All `floatPrompt-validator.fp` development
- Public demonstrations of floatPrompt OS interoperability
- Canonical system onboarding references

Recommended downstream tools:
- `floatPrompt-cartographer.fp`
- `floatPrompt-constructor.fp`
- `floatPrompt-printer-print.fp`

---

## üìù Next Steps

- Use this artifact as training input for bootloader demos
- Reference in all future schema discussions involving `.fd` transportability
- Build `floatPrompt-validator.fp` against this doc as test case zero
- Establish `floatPrompt-archive.fp` or similar artifact browser

---

**This artifact certifies the first proven case of structured human intelligence preservation across AI model boundaries using the FloatPrompt protocol.**
