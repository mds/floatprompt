# ðŸŽ¯ .fp Extension Strategic Realignment

This update implements a strategic realignment of the .fp extension migration based on architectural clarity about what constitutes a complete FloatPrompt versus building blocks.

## ðŸ§  Architectural Clarity Achieved

### **.fp File Definition (Canonical)**
**Complete FloatPrompt Documents:**
- Wrapped in `<floatprompt>content</floatprompt>` tags
- Full YAML frontmatter with complete behavioral specifications
- **Joint preserved and executable intelligence** (AI & Human readable)
- Designed for direct AI upload and execution

### **.md File Definition (Everything Else)**
**Building Blocks, Specs, Documentation:**
- Markdown content without FloatPrompt wrapper
- Informational or partial content
- Building components that assemble into complete FloatPrompts

## ðŸ”„ Strategic Corrections

### **Phase 1: REVERT Template System**
- **Action**: `src/template/*.fp` â†’ `src/template/*.md`
- **Rationale**: Template components are Markdown building blocks that assemble into complete FloatPrompts
- **Logic**: Building blocks â†’ Assembly â†’ Complete .fp document

### **Phase 2: SELECTIVE Development Workflow**
- **Migrate to .fp**: `update-protocol.md`, `update-creator.md` (complete FloatPrompts)
- **Keep .md**: `dev/updates/update-*.md` (specifications, not complete FloatPrompts)
- **Rationale**: Protocols execute behavior, specs describe changes

### **Phase 3: CANCEL Documentation Migration**
- **Action**: `src/docs/*.md` remains `src/docs/*.md`
- **Rationale**: Documentation is informational content, not executable FloatPrompts

### **Phase 4: CONFIRM Distribution Migration**
- **Action**: `dist/floatprompt-*.md` â†’ `dist/floatprompt-*.fp`
- **Rationale**: Distribution files ARE complete compiled FloatPrompts

## ðŸŽ¯ Architectural Principle

**`.fp` = Complete, executable FloatPrompt documents with full system authority**
**`.md` = Building blocks, documentation, specifications, and informational content**

This maintains archaeological integrity while establishing clear semantic boundaries for tooling, AI recognition, and ecosystem clarity.

> **This realignment ensures .fp extension is reserved for true 'joint preserved and executable intelligence' format - complete FloatPrompt documents designed for seamless AI & Human collaboration.**
