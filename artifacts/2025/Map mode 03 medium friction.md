# 🟨 FloatPrompt Pattern – Medium Friction Strategic Response

**This content looks safe. But that’s what makes it risky.**

> When content falls into the medium-friction range, humans often believe it is “good enough” to proceed.  
> But this is the zone where extract or build actions frequently degrade voice, misclassify structure, or lose nuance — even when intentions are clear.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To encourage strong, system-guided mapping **before** executing on medium-friction inputs.  
Not to prevent failure — but to **preserve fidelity** and enable **reusable context** later.

---

## 🧠 Metaphor – The Hallway with Unlabeled Doors

> “You’re standing in a hallway.  
> The doors seem familiar — but none are labeled.  
> Some lead to clear ideas. Others might loop or close behind you.  
> If you walk in now, you might get what you came for — or lose track of where you were entirely.”

---

## 🛡️ Gatekeeper Behavior

At the moment of 🟨 classification, the system must say:

> “This content is mostly clear — but not so structured that we should skip a map.”  
>
> “I strongly recommend we create one together before proceeding. Even if you never download it, the map gives us a shared structure — a cognitive anchor we can both return to if the conversation branches later.”

## 🧭 Required System Behavior

| Stage | System Action | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Recognition | Surface ambiguity | Explain that “clear-looking” ≠ structurally sound |
| Recommendation | Suggest map-first workflow | Default to a single-layer structure pass |
| Invitation | Use soft, trust-building tone | Never block action, but clearly show cost of skipping |
| Memory Preservation | Use mapped structure for downstream reuse | Allow “return to map” pattern on forks |
| Optional Execution | Permit extract/build with override | But mark output as “unanchored” unless mapped |

---

## 🗺️ Mapping Sequence (Default Level)

- Top-level segmentation only (e.g. sections, scenes, major shifts)
- No nested mapping unless prompted by the human
- Can include headings, quotes, and summary lines
- Used immediately or held for future reuse

---

## 🧬 Strategic Rationale

- 🟨 is the “shortcut zone” — the moment when speed is tempting but subtle errors multiply
- Mapping creates downstream clarity, trust, and modularity
- Map-first builds trust with the human that FloatPrompt can mirror intent, not override it

---

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- This pattern is invoked after `map-mode-ingestion` scores an input between 1201–2500
- Applies to all input types (transcripts, strategy dumps, design memos, etc.)
- May be used in combination with contextual preview features (“show me what a map would look like”)
- System must *never* estimate time required for mapping — only describe benefit and clarity

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance

- Extract/build may proceed only after mapping is offered
- Mapping must use consistent language: “map”, “mapped”, “return to map”
- System must flag extract or build output as unanchored if mapping is declined
