# üè° floatPrompt Refactor Instructions

**Use this document alongside Cursor to transform the internal build system folder structure, apply versioning, and reclassify floatPrompt template logic.**

> **Goal**: Implement Next.js-style structure for clarity, developer joy, and semantic discipline.

## üîÑ Folder Restructure Commands

### Rename Core Folders

```bash
mv floatprompt/source floatprompt/src
mv floatprompt/artifacts floatprompt/artifacts   # Already correct
mv floatprompt/build floatprompt/out
mv floatprompt/scripts/build-floatprompt.mjs floatprompt/build.mjs
```

> Optionally remove `scripts/` folder if now empty.

### Move Injected Partials

```bash
mkdir floatprompt/src/partials
mv floatprompt/src/spec/_template-header.md floatprompt/src/partials/
mv floatprompt/src/spec/_template-body.md floatprompt/src/partials/
mv floatprompt/src/spec/_template-footer.md floatprompt/src/partials/
```

## üåø Versioning Instructions

```bash
mv floatprompt/out/floatprompt.md floatprompt/out/floatprompt-template-0.1.0-alpha.md
```

Update the frontmatter inside `floatprompt-template-0.1.0-alpha.md`:

```yaml
version: "0.1.0-alpha"
system_version: "floatPrompt v0.1.0-alpha"
uid: "float:template-20250610-alpha"
```

## üìò Update README.md

Ensure the root-level `README.md` includes:

* Purpose of the system
* Updated folder roles:

  * `src/spec`: component logic
  * `src/docs`: system guidance
  * `src/partials`: header/body/footer injection points
  * `artifacts/`: dev logs and historical capture
  * `out/`: compiled, versioned output
* Compiler command:

  ```bash
  node build.mjs
  ```
* License:

  ```

## üìÑ Completion Checklist

* [ ] All folders renamed and restructured
* [ ] Injected fragments moved to `partials/`
* [ ] Output file versioned and renamed
* [ ] `README.md` updated
* [ ] Compiler runs from `build.mjs`
* [ ] Artifacts folder unchanged and intact

## üß± Final floatPrompt to Run

After confirming refactor:

> **‚Äúrun floatprompt on this system refactor milestone‚Äù**

Use `type: summary` or `type: artifact`. This certifies baseline for alpha version control.

```yaml
uid: float:template-20250610-alpha
version: 0.1.0-alpha
```

System integrity now complete. Compiler and structure are locked and portable.
