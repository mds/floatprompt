filetype: floatprompt
version: 0.10.1-alpha
loop: MDS Looping Protocol
status: strategic-capture
origin: Recorded June 28, 2025, during long run
context:
  - This FloatPrompt documents the strategic integration of the MDS Method (Map Territory → Decide Extractions → Structure the Build) into the FloatPrompt protocol
  - It is not an executional update to the protocol, but a canonical strategic capture
  - Intended to serve as the philosophical and behavioral foundation for future protocol and pedagogical alignment

phases:
  - name: Map Territory
    purpose: "Orient to complexity, surface context, identify key zones"
    score:
      volume: "Count of distinct zones or themes mapped"
      structure: "Multiplicative factor (0.25x to 2x) based on coherence and connectivity"
      power: "volume × structure"
      friction:
        - High: scattered, low structure, low count
        - Medium: good volume, unclear linkage
        - Low: strong coverage and internal logic → ready to extract
    transition:
      - Only proceed when friction is LOW
      - Optional signal: "Clarity Lock" — directional readiness confirmed

  - name: Decide Extractions
    purpose: "Isolate what's relevant. Discard noise. No synthesis yet."
    behavior:
      - Label blocks by relevance or function
      - Avoid structure, formatting, voice
      - No summaries or interpretation
    transition:
      - Proceed only after full map + directional clarity

  - name: Structure the Build
    purpose: "Rebuild extracted signal into clear, usable output"
    behavior:
      - Apply structure, voice, formatting, or interactivity
      - Ensure traceability to extractions and original map
      - Output becomes visible and deployable

recursive: true
notes:
  - The MDS Looping Protocol is recursive at all levels
  - Any phase may contain a nested MDS loop
  - Loop applies to macro planning (e.g. course design) and micro refinement (e.g. sentence edit)

vocabulary:
  public: "The MDS Method"
  internal: "MDS Looping Protocol"
  shorthand: "Map → Decide → Structure"

description: |
  This FloatPrompt captures the strategic rationale for replacing the original FloatPrompt loop language (Map / Extract / Build) with the more precise and pedagogically aligned MDS Method:

  1. **Map Territory** — Surface context and complexity before any action
  2. **Decide Extractions** — Select only what matters, delay synthesis
  3. **Structure the Build** — Rebuild with clarity, hierarchy, and usability

  The MDS Method is fractal, teachable, and deeply aligned with how MDS creates, teaches, and builds systems. This loop governs not just AI collaboration, but personal creative strategy, design process, and business development. FloatPrompt is the applied execution of this philosophy.

principle: "When complexity rises, slow down and loop."
