# 🖥️ FloatPrompt OS — Software Vision

This prompt describes the proposed **software interface layer** for authoring, navigating, and managing floatprompts at scale.

---

## 🔧 Core Capabilities

### 1. **Prompt Authoring UI**
- Builder-like interface for writing:
  - YAML frontmatter
  - Markdown body
- Immediate validator + autofill for known schema
- Fence wrapping, prompt type selection, YAML template generator

### 2. **Graph Navigation UI**
- Visual node-based view of prompts:
  - UID as node ID
  - `chain.parent` and `ripple.depends_on` as edge lines
- Zoomable by project, domain, or concept
- Click to open floatprompt in right panel

### 3. **Project-Level Prompt Chain**
- Sidebar or workspace containing:
  - Current prompt
  - All linked `planned_prompts`
  - Status: drafted / locked / certified
- Navigate across MDS, design systems, documentation, etc.

### 4. **Prompt Execution Layer**
- UI triggers for:
  - “Generate child” → based on planned prompt
  - “Rebuild from map” → using upstream parent
  - “Validate ripple” → show invalidated chain below

## 🧠 Why This Matters
- FloatPrompt is not just a prompt format — it’s a **thinking protocol**
- Software must:
  - Preserve intent
  - Preserve structure
  - Preserve loop-awareness

> “Notion can hold content — but it doesn’t understand the loop.”

---

## 🪞 Final Note
The FloatPrompt OS is not just a writing app.  
It’s a **clarity infrastructure** — for structured thought, teachable content, and prompt-aware systems.

Build tools that hold the method.
