# floatPrompt Developer Questions from Manifesto Review

**Type**: Artifact - Revisit Queue  
**Created**: 2025-01-09  
**Context**: Questions emerged from a developer reading the manifesto with excitement  
**Status**: Parked for future specification and tooling development  

---

## ðŸ¤” Questions That Emerged

These are the natural technical questions a developer asks after falling in love with the floatPrompt vision:

### 1. CLI Tool for floatPrompt Management
**Question**: Is there a CLI tool for floatPrompt management?  
**Potential Location**: `tools/` directory  
**Scope**: Command-line utilities for creating, validating, chaining, and managing floatPrompts

### 2. Schema Validation
**Question**: How do you handle schema validation?  
**Potential Location**: `schema/` directory and `spec/` technical documentation  
**Scope**: Validation rules, format checking, constitutional compliance verification

### 3. VS Code Extensions  
**Question**: Any plans for VS Code extensions?  
**Potential Location**: `tools/` or dedicated `integrations/` directory  
**Scope**: Editor support, syntax highlighting, floatPrompt creation helpers, voice integration

### 4. Git Integration Patterns
**Question**: Git integration patterns?  
**Potential Location**: `tools/` workflow guides or `spec/` documentation  
**Scope**: Version control workflows, branching strategies, collaborative floatPrompt development

### 5. Voice Calibration Mechanics
**Question**: How does voice calibration actually work?  
**Potential Location**: `spec/` technical implementation details  
**Scope**: Voice system architecture, calibration processes, session context management

## ðŸŽ¯ Observation: Manifesto Success

The manifesto successfully:
- âœ… Inspired excitement about the vision
- âœ… Communicated core principles clearly  
- âœ… Generated natural technical curiosity
- âœ… Left implementation questions for appropriate documentation layers

The developer's enthusiasm and specific technical questions indicate the manifesto achieved its purpose: **inspiring vision without getting bogged down in implementation details**.

## ðŸ”® Future Development Areas

When ready to address these questions:

1. **Developer Onboarding Flow** - Clear path from manifesto â†’ spec â†’ tools
2. **Technical Documentation Architecture** - Systematic coverage of implementation questions  
3. **Tooling Ecosystem** - CLI, editor integrations, validation tools
4. **Community Contribution Guidelines** - How developers can extend the ecosystem

## ðŸ“‹ Next Actions (When Ready)

- [ ] Expand technical specification to address core implementation questions
- [ ] Design CLI tool architecture and commands
- [ ] Create editor integration specifications  
- [ ] Document git workflow patterns
- [ ] Detail voice calibration technical implementation

**Note**: These questions should live in `spec/` and `tools/` directories, not the manifesto. The manifesto's job is pure vision and philosophy.
