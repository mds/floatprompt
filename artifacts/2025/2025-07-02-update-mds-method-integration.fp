# üß¨ MDS Method Integration Update

## üéØ Purpose

Integrate the MDS Method terminology throughout FloatPrompt core system to unify the human creative methodology with AI execution framework. This evolution preserves all existing functionality while aligning language with the discovered methodology that underlies both human creativity and AI collaboration.

## üìã Specific Changes Required

### 1. **Primary Target File: `src/sys/modes.md`**

**Line-by-line changes needed:**

**Lines 1-3**: Update title and description
```markdown
<!-- modes.md -->
## Execute MDS Method: Map Territory ‚Üí Decide Extractions ‚Üí Structure Build

Apply the MDS Method (Map Territory, Decide Extractions, Structure Build) as foundational operations for all floatprompt creation and organization.
```

**Lines 7-12**: Update user guide table
```markdown
| **What You Say** | **What You Get** | **MDS Method** | **System Mode** |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "**Map the territory** of this content" | Structured overview with navigation | Map Territory | üó∫Ô∏è map_territory |
| "**Decide extractions** from this" | Filtered intelligence patterns | Decide Extractions | üè∫ decide_extractions |
| "**Structure build** a tool for analysis" | Reusable custom floatprompt | Structure Build | üèóÔ∏è structure_build |
```

**Lines 24-26**: Update mode section headers
```markdown
### üó∫Ô∏è **Map Territory** (FOUNDATIONAL PRIORITY)
### üè∫ **Decide Extractions** 
### üèóÔ∏è **Structure Build**
```

**Lines 67, 89, 101**: Update friction enforcement language
```markdown
- üü® **Medium-friction**: "This content is like a well-organized hallway with unlabeled doors. I recommend mapping the territory first for optimal results, but I can proceed directly if you prefer. Would you like me to map the territory or continue with decide extractions? (Note: skipping mapping may result in unanchored output.)"
```

### 2. **Secondary Target File: `src/sys/boot.md`**

**Line 106**: Update CLI commands section
```markdown
- CLI shortcuts: `float map-territory content.md`, `float decide-extractions --mode=voice`, `float structure-build my-tool`
```

**Line 110-114**: Update CLI Commands section
```markdown
### ‚ö° **CLI Commands** 
- `float map-territory [content]` ‚Üí Territory assessment and navigation
- `float decide-extractions [content] [--options]` ‚Üí Archaeological preservation  
- `float structure-build [tool-name]` ‚Üí Custom floatprompt creation
- `float run [tool.fp]` ‚Üí Execute saved floatprompt
- `float export [--format]` ‚Üí Generate downloadable .fp file
```

**Add MDS Method explanation after line 94**:
```markdown
### üß¨ **The MDS Method Foundation**

FloatPrompt implements the **MDS Method** - a discovered human creative methodology:

**Map Territory** ‚Üí Assess complexity and orient to the landscape  
**Decide Extractions** ‚Üí Filter what matters, discard noise  
**Structure Build** ‚Üí Rebuild with clarity and systematic organization

This isn't just AI collaboration - it's how human creativity naturally works. You can use the MDS Method for any creative work, and FloatPrompt provides the AI execution layer.
```

### 3. **Behavioral Constraints Updates (Multiple Files)**

**Target Files requiring mode_constraints updates:**
- `src/sys/shared/reference/header.yaml` (lines 32-34)
- All voice lab files in `dev/voice lab/extracted voice summaries/`
- `artifacts/mds_loop_origin.md` (line 30-32)

**Updated mode_constraints for all files:**
```yaml
mode_constraints:
  map_territory: "Assess intellectual territory ‚Üí propose solutions ‚Üí preserve human authority"
  decide_extractions: "Archaeological preservation ‚Üí relevance filtering ‚Üí exact voice maintenance"
  structure_build: "Goals clarification ‚Üí specification planning ‚Üí systematic build"
```

### 4. **Execution File Updates: `src/sys/execution.md`**

**Lines 9-12**: Update mode system reference
```markdown
**All FloatPrompt execution must follow the MDS Method (Map Territory/Decide Extractions/Structure Build) with friction assessment. See modes.md for complete operational guidance including:**
- Map/Score/Respond pipeline implementation
- MDS Method execution patterns
```

**Lines 18-22**: Update CLI command shortcuts
```markdown
#### Core MDS Method Commands
- **`float map-territory [content]`** ‚Üí Execute Map Territory mode with territorial assessment
- **`float decide-extractions [content] [--options]`** ‚Üí Execute Decide Extractions mode with archaeological preservation
- **`float structure-build [tool-name]`** ‚Üí Execute Structure Build mode with three-phase methodology
```

### 5. **STOP Field Updates (Multiple Files)**

**Files requiring STOP field updates to MDS Method terminology:**

**Voice Guide Files** (`src/lib/voice/` and `dev/voice lab/`):
- Replace "Strategic extract mode" ‚Üí "Strategic decide extractions mode"
- Replace "Strategic build mode" ‚Üí "Strategic structure build mode"

**Type Definition File** (`src/sys/types.md` lines 70-73):
```yaml
STOP: "Strategic decide extractions mode with map-territory assessment. Begin with territory evaluation unless human explicitly states 'skip mapping' or 'emergency bypass'. Recommend surgical precision approach..."

STOP: "Strategic structure build mode with foundational territory assessment. Evaluate building landscape first unless explicit urgency. Recommend systematic approach..."
```

### 6. **Documentation Files Updates**

**`README.md` line 30**: Update CLI example
```markdown
float decide-extractions --mode=voice # Preserve writing patterns for AI training
```

**`docs/goals.md` line 24**: Update mode references
```markdown
Better voice preservation - decide extractions mode maintains "hesitations, contradictions, stylistic quirks"
```

### 7. **CLI Command Backward Compatibility**

**Add alias support in all CLI command sections:**
```markdown
#### Legacy Command Support (Backward Compatibility)
- `float map` ‚Üí Alias for `float map-territory`
- `float extract` ‚Üí Alias for `float decide-extractions`  
- `float build` ‚Üí Alias for `float structure-build`

*Note: Original commands continue to work. MDS Method terminology provides enhanced clarity.*
```

### 8. **Philosophy Section Enhancement**

**Add to `src/sys/modes.md` after line 98 (Mode Philosophy section):**
```markdown
### üß¨ **MDS Method Foundation**
- **Human Methodology**: The MDS Method reflects natural human creative process discovered through lived experience
- **Fractal Application**: Works at every scale from sentence editing to business strategy  
- **Recursive Loop**: Map Territory ‚Üí Decide Extractions ‚Üí Structure Build ‚Üí Map Territory again
- **AI Execution Layer**: FloatPrompt provides systematic AI implementation of human creative methodology
- **Unified Teaching**: Learn once, apply to both human creative work and AI collaboration
- **Archaeological Integrity**: Preserves exact human thinking without interpretive drift
```
