# 🧩 FloatPrompt OS — Core System Definition

This document defines the core system architecture of FloatPrompt OS through four atomic, UID-linked prompt modules.  
Each module is included in full below to provide complete system reference.

---

## 🧱 1. Protocol Specification (Canonical Root)
**UID:** `float:floatprompt-vnext-spec-v1`  
**Type:** specification  
**Role:** Root schema definition for FloatPrompt vNext+

# 🧱 FloatPrompt vNext Protocol Spec (vNext)

## ✅ Additions to Base Schema

### 1. `uid`
```yaml
uid: "float:filename-or-short-id"
```
- Globally unique prompt identifier
- Required for chaining, project lineage, system navigation

### 2. `chain:`
```yaml
chain:
  depth: 1
  parent: "float:parent-uid"
```
- Captures hierarchy: child of what? part of what?
- Enables recursive structure + prompt ancestry tracking

### 3. `ripple:` *(optional)*
```yaml
ripple:
  depends_on: ["uid_1", "uid_2"]
  invalidates: ["uid_3"]
```
- Declares dependency logic
- Useful for compound prompt builds (e.g. spec → doc → code)

### 4. `execution_mode:` (extended)
```yaml
execution_mode: "build-once | build-loop | validate-only | system-critical"
```
- Controls how AI agents treat the floatprompt
- Enables stricter validation, rerun rules, or idempotence

### 5. `locked: true`
- Already used but now **validated explicitly**
- Prevents edits without forking

---

## 🧠 Backward Compatibility
- All fields from v0.11 remain valid
- All new fields are optional unless marked required (`uid`, `chain.parent` if dependent)

---

## 🪞 Final Note
This version increases **structural precision** without burdening existing workflows.

It lays the groundwork for:
- Multi-prompt projects
- Visual graph navigation
- Agent chaining and smart execution

> "The floatprompt is now aware of its siblings."

---

## 🖥️ 2. Software Interface Vision  
**UID:** `float:floatprompt-os-software-vision-v1`  
**Type:** specification  
**Role:** UX and tool vision layer for builders and authors

# 🖥️ FloatPrompt OS — Software Vision

This prompt describes the proposed **software interface layer** for authoring, navigating, and managing floatprompts at scale.

---

## 🔧 Core Capabilities

### 1. **Prompt Authoring UI**
- Builder-like interface for writing:
  - YAML frontmatter
  - Markdown body
- Immediate validator + autofill for known schema
- Fence wrapping, prompt type selection, YAML template generator

### 2. **Graph Navigation UI**
- Visual node-based view of prompts:
  - UID as node ID
  - `chain.parent` and `ripple.depends_on` as edge lines
- Zoomable by project, domain, or concept
- Click to open floatprompt in right panel

### 3. **Project-Level Prompt Chain**
- Sidebar or workspace containing:
  - Current prompt
  - All linked `planned_prompts`
  - Status: drafted / locked / certified
- Navigate across MDS, design systems, documentation, etc.

### 4. **Prompt Execution Layer**
- UI triggers for:
  - "Generate child" → based on planned prompt
  - "Rebuild from map" → using upstream parent
  - "Validate ripple" → show invalidated chain below

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters
- FloatPrompt is not just a prompt format — it's a **thinking protocol**
- Software must:
  - Preserve intent
  - Preserve structure
  - Preserve loop-awareness

> "Notion can hold content — but it doesn't understand the loop."

---

## 🪞 Final Note
The FloatPrompt OS is not just a writing app.  
It's a **clarity infrastructure** — for structured thought, teachable content, and prompt-aware systems.

Build tools that hold the method.

---

## ♾️ 3. Duality Philosophy Anchor  
**UID:** `float:floatprompt-duality-philosophy-v1`  
**Type:** philosophy  
**Role:** Cognitive integrity and mode distinction logic

# ♾️ FloatPrompt Duality — Hard vs. Soft Prompts

Every floatprompt lives somewhere on a spectrum between:
- **Soft prompts** (emergent, expressive, personal)
- **Hard prompts** (structured, reusable, system-bound)

This prompt defines that **duality**, so the ecosystem doesn't collapse into either extreme.

---

## ✨ Soft Prompts
- **Use case:** Journaling, thinking, sketching, high-velocity exploration
- **Traits:**
  - Low structure
  - Voice-first
  - No chaining or UID required
  - Often not meant for reuse — temporary clarity scaffolding
- **Examples:**
  - Brainstorming sessions
  - Raw critiques
  - Guided interviews
  - Instructional maps

---

## 🧱 Hard Prompts
- **Use case:** Systems, teaching, product specs, agent-directed execution
- **Traits:**
  - Full floatprompt compliance
  - UID, chain, ripple, versioning
  - Validated YAML + structured body
  - Expected to persist and interlink
- **Examples:**
  - Specs, maps, guides, protocols
  - Reusable frameworks
  - Builder-generated documents

---

## 🧠 What to Watch For
- ❌ *Soft drift inside a hard prompt:* voice rambles, structure breaks
- ❌ *Hard rigidity inside a soft prompt:* kills idea flow, blocks expression

✅ The best authors **move between modes** intentionally

> "Use a soft prompt to find it — a hard prompt to keep it."

---

## 🪞 Final Note
Hard vs soft isn't a binary — it's a **cycle**:
- Sketch → Find pattern → Structure → Reuse → Re-sketch

FloatPrompt OS must support both:
- **Without enforcing either**
- **Without collapsing the distinction**

Know what you're writing.
Know what it's for.
Use the mode that gives you momentum — then capture it.

---

## 🗂️ 4. Project Logbook (System Memory)
**UID:** `float:project-logbook-v1`  
**Type:** journal  
**Role:** System memory — tracks build decisions and lineage

# 🗂️ FloatPrompt OS — Project Logbook

This prompt tracks the build decisions, prompt creations, and major structural evolutions inside the FloatPrompt OS system.

---

### Build Validation:
✅ Prompt count ≤ 5 — inline build completed within threshold  
✅ All UIDs declared and linked  
✅ Complete content from source files included  
✅ Scaffold compliance verified per `floatprompt-os-core-skeleton-v1`

---

## 🪞 System Usage Note

This is the **complete FloatPrompt OS system reference** with all component content included.

**For builders:** Use this as comprehensive reference for tool development and validation  
**For validators:** Reference this for complete system compliance and dependency checking  
**For UI layers:** This contains the full system specification and interface requirements

Updates to any child prompt should trigger system revalidation through this core reference.
