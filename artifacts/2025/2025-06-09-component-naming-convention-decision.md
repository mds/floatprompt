# ⚡ floatPrompt Component Naming Convention - Next.js Style Decision

**Next.js-inspired semantic naming convention for maximum developer experience and Vercel ecosystem alignment**

> **"Would these names be Guillermo/Vercel/Next.js approved?"** - @mds strategic ecosystem alignment question

> **"Let's go with the most Next.js mode as possible."** - @mds final decision

*This specification documents the Next.js-style semantic naming convention decision for floatPrompt component architecture, optimizing for developer experience, simplicity, and alignment with modern tooling patterns.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Document the final naming convention decision for floatPrompt modular component architecture, establishing Next.js-style semantic naming that maximizes developer experience, eliminates cognitive overhead, and aligns with Vercel ecosystem conventions.

### 🔑 Key Decision Criteria
- **Skeptical developer approval** through maximum simplicity
- **Vercel/Next.js ecosystem alignment** for strategic partnership compatibility
- **Zero cognitive overhead** for component identification and organization
- **Modern tooling pattern compatibility** for developer adoption

---

## ⚡ Final Naming Convention: Next.js Style

### 🎯 **Complete Component List (13 Components)**

```
config.md           # frontmatter/YAML structure and metadata
execution.md        # creation process, AI uncertainty protocol
voice.md            # preservation oath, archaeological extraction
types.md            # classification system and type definitions
modes.md            # cartographer, constructor, extractor, curator
chaining.md         # workflow orchestration, shadowPrompt spawning
structure.md        # body template, markdown format requirements
discovery.md        # relationship metadata, navigation intelligence
validation.md       # checklist, compliance requirements
enforcement.md      # integrity rules, contributor policies
naming.md           # file conventions, casing rules
metadata.md         # format requirements, design philosophy
attribution.md      # universal footer, licensing requirements
```

### 🔥 **Why This Is Next.js-Approved**

**Matches Next.js File Patterns:**
- **Single purpose clarity** (like `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `loading.tsx`)
- **No prefixes or categories** (functional names only)
- **Immediately obvious function** (zero interpretation required)
- **Clean developer experience** (no mental mapping needed)

**Vercel Engineering Culture Alignment:**
- **Simplicity over clever organization** → Functional names without abstraction
- **Developer experience focused** → Clear, obvious, scannable
- **No unnecessary complexity** → Direct naming without categorization overhead
- **Modern tooling compatibility** → Works with any developer workflow

---

## 📊 Naming Decision Analysis

### 🚨 **Approaches Evaluated and Rejected**

**Sequential Numbering (Original):**
```
_01-frontmatter.md, _02-execution.md, _03-voice-preservation.md
```
**Problem:** Maintenance burden when inserting new components, artificial ordering

**Semantic Numbering with Gaps:**
```
_10-frontmatter.md, _20-execution.md, _30-voice-preservation.md
```
**Problem:** Still artificial numbering, legacy programming pattern

**Semantic Categories with Prefixes:**
```
foundation-frontmatter.md, system-voice-preservation.md, structure-body.md
```
**Problem:** Over-engineered for Vercel team, unnecessary categorization overhead

### ✅ **Next.js Style Advantages**

**Developer Experience Benefits:**
- **Zero learning curve** → Names are immediately obvious
- **No mental mapping** → Function clear from filename
- **Grep-friendly** → Easy to find specific functionality
- **IDE-friendly** → Clean autocomplete and navigation

**Vercel Ecosystem Compatibility:**
- **Matches Next.js conventions** → Familiar to Vercel developers
- **Simple and functional** → Aligns with modern React patterns
- **No cognitive overhead** → Skeptical developer approved
- **Professional appearance** → Enterprise-ready organization

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### 📋 **Current to New Component Mapping**

**Foundation Components:**
- `_01-frontmatter.yaml` → `config.md`
- `_02-frontmatter.md` → *content merged into config.md*
- `_03-execution.md` → `execution.md`
- `_04-voice-preservation.md` → `voice.md`

**System Components:**
- `_05-type-system.md` → `types.md`
- `_06-core-modes.md` → `modes.md`
- `_07-chaining.md` → `chaining.md`

**Structure Components:**
- `_08-body.md` → `structure.md`
- `_09-discovery.md` → `discovery.md`

**Validation Components:**
- `_10-checklist.md` → `validation.md`
- `_11-enforce.md` → `enforcement.md`

**Convention Components:**
- `_12-naming.md` → `naming.md`
- `_13-metadata.md` → `metadata.md`
- `_14-attribution.md` → `attribution.md`

### 🔧 **Implementation Steps**

**Phase 1: File Rename and Content Consolidation**
1. **Rename all component files** to new semantic naming convention
2. **Consolidate frontmatter content** (merge _01 and _02 into config.md)
3. **Update build system** to reference new component names
4. **Test compilation process** with new naming structure

**Phase 2: Reference Updates**
1. **Update all cross-references** between components
2. **Modify build scripts** to use new component names
3. **Update documentation** referencing old component numbers
4. **Validate link integrity** across all floatPrompt files

**Phase 3: System Validation**
1. **Test complete build process** with new naming convention
2. **Validate component compilation** and output generation
3. **Verify cross-reference accuracy** and link functionality
4. **Document migration completion** and new naming standards

## 🎯 Component Organization Logic

### 🏗️ **Natural Grouping (No Enforced Categories)**

**Foundation (Core Requirements):**
- **config.md** → Essential structure and metadata
- **execution.md** → Creation and processing protocols
- **voice.md** → Preservation and extraction principles

**System (Operational Framework):**
- **types.md** → Classification and categorization
- **modes.md** → Core operational patterns
- **chaining.md** → Advanced workflow orchestration

**Content (Structure and Discovery):**
- **structure.md** → Body templates and formatting
- **discovery.md** → Relationship and navigation metadata

**Quality (Validation and Standards):**
- **validation.md** → Compliance and quality assurance
- **enforcement.md** → Integrity and contributor policies

**Meta (Conventions and Standards):**
- **naming.md** → File and component conventions
- **metadata.md** → Format requirements and philosophy
- **attribution.md** → Licensing and credit requirements

### 🌊 **Emergent Organization Benefits**

**No Artificial Constraints:**
- **Logical grouping emerges naturally** without enforced categorization
- **Component relationships clear** from functional names
- **Easy mental model** for developers and contributors
- **Flexible evolution** as system grows and changes
