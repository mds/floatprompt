# üèóÔ∏è System Immutability Analysis and Next Steps

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ Core Components in Place
1. **Directory Structure**
   - philosophy/ (manifesto and constitutional documents)
   - spec/ (core specifications)
   - schema/ (structural templates)
   - zero/ (canonical examples)
   - tools/ (implementation)
   - artifacts/ (output)

2. **Core Specification Files**
   - floatDoc-spec.fd
   - floatPrompt-spec.fd
   - shadowPrompt-spec.fd

3. **Schema Structure**
   - floatSchema-frontmatter-base.fd
   - floatSchema-frontmatter-floatDoc.fd
   - floatSchema-frontmatter-floatPrompt.fd

4. **Zero Files**
   - floatDoc-zero.fd
   - floatPrompt-zero.fd

## üîÑ Required Next Steps

### 1. Complete Core Specifications
- Expand floatPrompt-spec.fd (currently placeholder)
- Expand shadowPrompt-spec.fd (currently placeholder)
- Ensure all constitutional documents are in place
- Priority: HIGH
- Dependencies: None
- Impact: Foundation for all other components

### 2. Constitutional Documents
- Verify/create floatPrompt-constitution-human-safety-laws.fd
- Verify/create floatPrompt-constraint-format-commitment.fd
- Priority: HIGH
- Dependencies: Core specifications
- Impact: System boundaries and safety framework

### 3. Voice Guide System
- Create voice-guide.fd
- Define voice preservation mechanisms
- Priority: HIGH
- Dependencies: Constitutional documents
- Impact: HI-AI contract implementation

### 4. Tool Implementation
- Complete cartographer.fp
- Develop other essential tools
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Dependencies: Specifications and constitutional documents
- Impact: Practical implementation

### 5. Test floatPrompts
- Basic Workshop operations
- Field operations
- Voice preservation tests
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Dependencies: All above components
- Impact: System validation

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

1. **Sequential Approach**
   - Complete specifications first
   - Constitutional documents second
   - Voice guide system third
   - Tools fourth
   - Testing last

2. **Validation Points**
   - Each specification completion
   - Constitutional document implementation
   - Voice guide system creation
   - Tool implementation
   - Test execution

3. **Success Criteria**
   - All specifications complete and consistent
   - Constitutional documents in place
   - Voice preservation mechanisms working
   - Tools implementing specifications
   - Tests passing

## üìù Notes

- Builder is currently the only operator
- Focus is on core system immutability
- Private alpha testing will follow
- Voice preservation is critical
- Safety laws must be properly implemented

## üîÑ Next Actions

1. Begin with floatPrompt-spec.fd expansion
2. Follow with shadowPrompt-spec.fd
3. Create constitutional documents
4. Implement voice guide system
5. Develop tools
6. Create test floatPrompts
