# üîß FloatPrompt Component Filename Comments Patch

**Systematic patch for adding filename comments to source template components to improve maintenance traceability and development efficiency.**

> **Core Objective**: Enable instant source component identification in compiled floatprompt output through HTML filename comments.

## üéØ Enhancement Specification

### Add Component Filename Comments
- **Target**: All source template components in `src/template/*.md`
- **Exception**: `header.md` (becomes frontmatter, no comment needed)
- **Format**: `<!-- filename.md -->` as first line of each file
- **Purpose**: Maintenance traceability and development efficiency

### Implementation Details
- **Comment placement**: First line of each component file
- **Consistent format**: `<!-- filename.md -->` exactly
- **Build integration**: Comments appear at section boundaries in compiled output
- **Maintenance workflow**: Enable Find ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Rebuild instead of search cycles

## üîç Rationale

### **Maintenance Efficiency Enhancement**
When using compiled floatprompt in production and discovering needed changes (like the recent curator removal), filename comments enable instant source component identification instead of searching through 12+ files.

### **Archaeological Integrity Preservation**
Preserves build lineage by making each section traceable to its source component, maintaining clear separation between different concerns and enabling precise reconstruction.

### **Development Velocity Improvement**
Enables surgical updates with streamlined workflow: identify issue in compiled output ‚Üí see filename comment ‚Üí edit specific component ‚Üí rebuild. Eliminates cognitive load of mental mapping between compiled sections and source files.

### **Collaboration Enhancement**
Anyone can quickly identify which component to modify without deep system knowledge, improving team development efficiency and reducing onboarding complexity.

## üéØ Impact Assessment

### **Positive Impacts**
- **Faster iteration cycles** for maintenance and updates
- **Reduced cognitive load** during development
- **Better archaeological preservation** of build lineage
- **Improved collaboration** through clear component boundaries
- **Systematic refactor support** for future changes

### **Implementation Requirements**
- Add comments to all applicable source components
- Rebuild system to generate updated distribution
- Verify comments appear at appropriate section boundaries
- Test maintenance workflow with comment-guided updates

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Compliance

### **System Integrity**
- Comments are HTML format, invisible to AI processing
- No impact on floatprompt functionality or behavior
- Maintains all existing system architecture and goals
- Preserves voice preservation and archaeological extraction principles

### **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing floatprompts remain fully functional
- No breaking changes to user workflows
- Comments enhance but don't modify core functionality
- Build system continues normal operation

**Status**: Ready for implementation through `_dev-update-floatprompt` execution protocol.
