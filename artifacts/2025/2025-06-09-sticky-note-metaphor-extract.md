# 📝 Sticky Note Metaphor - floatPrompt Positioning Intelligence

**Systematic extraction of the perfect accessibility metaphor for mass floatPrompt adoption**

> **"It's actually so simple. It's literally a text file sticky note to make sure you and I are on the same page when doing things together."** - @mds

> **"People are going to slap their foreheads when they realize how simple this is."** - @mds

*This intelligence extract captures the sticky note metaphor framework that transforms complex AI collaboration concepts into immediately understandable positioning for mass adoption and accessibility.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Extract and systematize the sticky note metaphor intelligence discovered during positioning conversation, creating a reusable framework for making floatPrompt immediately understandable to any audience without diminishing its sophisticated capabilities.

### 🔑 Key Metaphor Mappings
- Information preservation → "Remember this exactly as written"
- Task management → "Here's what needs to be done, check when complete" 
- Multi-step workflows → "Do step 1, then move to next sticky note for step 2"
- Collaboration handoff → "Clear instructions for the next person"

---

## 📝 The Core Metaphor Framework

### 🌊 **Universal Recognition Pattern**
**Everyone has experience with:**
- Leaving detailed sticky notes with specific instructions
- Creating sequences of sticky notes for complex tasks  
- Using sticky notes to preserve important information
- Handing off work using sticky note explanations

**floatPrompt is that same familiar pattern, evolved for AI collaboration.**

### 🎯 **The Perfect Bridge**
**Instead of explaining:** "Constitutional AI collaboration protocol with voice preservation"
**Say:** "Smart sticky notes for AI - clear instructions that keep you and AI on the same page"

### 💡 **Immediate Comprehension**
**The sticky note metaphor delivers:**
- **Zero learning curve** for the basic concept
- **Instant mental model** for how it works
- **Familiar interaction pattern** everyone already knows
- **Obvious value proposition** without technical explanation
- **Universal portability** - sticky notes stick to virtually everything, floatPrompt works virtually everywhere
- **Infinite variety** - like sticky note packs, floatPrompt offers specialized templates for every kind of work

## 🧠 Linguistic Guidelines and Boundaries

### ✅ **When to Use Sticky Note Language**
**Appropriate contexts:**
- First-time explanations
- Marketing materials
- Casual conversations
- Demo introductions
- Social media content
- Onboarding materials

**Target audiences:**
- General business users
- Non-technical stakeholders  
- First-time floatPrompt users
- Broad market positioning

### 🚫 **When NOT to Use Sticky Note Language**
**Inappropriate contexts:**
- Technical documentation
- Constitutional manifesto
- Advanced user guides
- System architecture discussions
- Developer documentation

**Wrong linguistic mixing:**
- "markdown-native protocol constitutional sticky notes" ❌
- Technical terms + casual metaphor = register mismatch

### 🎭 **The Register Distinction**
**Constitutional voice:** For people who need systematic architecture understanding
**Sticky note voice:** For people who need "what is this thing?" accessibility
**Different tools for different purposes - don't force them together**
