# üè∫ Certification and Human Fingerprint Schema Upgrade

**Upgrade floatPrompt schema with authorship locking, certification authority, execution origin, and inferred state tracking**

> **Enables 10/10 compliance fidelity for artifact traceability, authorship confirmation, and immutable certification across systems**

*This plan provides structural requirements, field definitions, and integration steps to evolve floatPrompt schema for enhanced trust, execution clarity, and cross-platform provenance.*

---

## üéØ Purpose

Upgrade floatPrompt metadata schema to include:
- Stronger certification controls for locking, authority, and audit-ready origin tracing
- Human execution fingerprint clarity (signed authorship, execution mode, and AI inference awareness)

### üîë Key Principles
- All upgrades must be soft-coded and backward-compatible
- Schema must remain readable, writable, and AI-traceable
- No field introduces PII or privacy compromise
- Certification must support future automation, cryptographic signing, and chain-of-custody tracking

---

## üìù Main Content

### üßæ Section 1: Certification Metadata Extensions

```yaml
certification:
  authority: "schema-compliance | execution-verified | voice-preserved"
  certified_by: "@mds" | "Claude Sonnet" | "ChatGPT 4o"
  locked: true
  uid: "float:7b9c82f2d4e0"
```

- `authority`: Describes what this certification validates
- `certified_by`: Declares the certifier identity (human or AI)
- `locked`: Flags the floatPrompt as immutable for archival or downstream use
- `uid`: Unique hash or symbolic identifier for this exact version

---

### üßç Section 2: Human Execution Fingerprint Extensions

```yaml
human:
  execution_mode: "structured" | "spontaneous" | "hybrid"
  signed_by: "@mds"
  inferred_fields: ["clarity", "energy"]
```

- `execution_mode`: Clarifies whether the floatPrompt was premeditated or improvised
- `signed_by`: Optional, final authorship acknowledgment
- `inferred_fields`: AI-inferred metadata for clarity and trace separation

---

## üîó Relationships

### Prerequisites
- `floatPrompt.md`
- `floatPrompt-spec-frontmatter-template.md`

### Next Steps
- Create `spec-certification.md` and `spec-human.md` to document new schema
- Update `spec-validation.md` with optional checks for these fields
- Include fields in compiler defaults with `TODO` if values are missing
- Test impact on version control and delta generation

- `floatPrompt-soft-coded-construction.md`

## üìù Implementation Notes

- Fields are soft-coded and optional
- Compiler should infer where appropriate, but clearly label inferred fields
- All additions must preserve schema integrity and validation structure
- `uid` field may evolve into cryptographic signature in future spec versions

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Compliance

- No field reveals sensitive human data
- Authorship is declared voluntarily
- Locking only applies to certified floatPrompts with intentional `locked: true` flag
- Field values may be overridden for drafts, internal prompts, or collaborative sessions

**Built in collaboration with Claude Sonnet**

*This floatPrompt ensures the floatPrompt protocol reaches next-level fidelity, trust, and artifact immutability across AI systems.*
