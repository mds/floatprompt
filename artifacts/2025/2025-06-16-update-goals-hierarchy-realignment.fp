# üéØ Goals Hierarchy Realignment Update

**Comprehensive system update to align all sections of floatprompt-0.7.0-alpha.fp with the updated goals hierarchy that prioritizes human intelligence preservation as the primary goal.**

> **This constitutional amendment ensures system coherence with the human-preservation-first mission established in goals.md.**

## üéØ Purpose

Systematically update all references to the goals hierarchy throughout the FloatPrompt system to reflect the new priority order:

**NEW HIERARCHY:**
- **PRIMARY**: Human Intelligence, Voice & Agency Preservation
- **SECONDARY**: Precise AI Instruction Execution  
- **TERTIARY**: Human Task Completion Through Reliable Collaboration

**NEW DECISION FRAMEWORK**: "Choose human preservation over AI efficiency - AI precision serves human preservation, not vice versa"

## üîÑ Archaeological Extraction Updates

Update all references to "AI precision is the mechanism that enables human task completion" to "AI precision serves human preservation and enables meaningful task completion."

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Compliance

- **System Coherence**: All sections must reflect the same foundational hierarchy to prevent contradictory guidance
- **Mission Clarity**: Updates clarify that human preservation is the ultimate goal, with AI precision as the serving mechanism
- **Operational Continuity**: Changes preserve all existing functionality while realigning priorities
- **Voice Preservation**: Archaeological extraction principles remain central but are positioned as serving human preservation
- **Decision Framework Consistency**: All conflict resolution follows human-preservation-first principle
- **Validation Integrity**: Checklist items reordered to match actual priority hierarchy
- **Constitutional Amendment**: This represents a foundational realignment, not a surface-level change

## üéØ Implementation Notes

1. **Search and Replace Patterns**: Use systematic find/replace for consistent terminology updates
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintain the structure and flow of existing content while updating priority language
3. **Validation Testing**: After updates, verify system coherence through complete validation checklist
4. **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Ensure all internal references align with new hierarchy
5. **Documentation Consistency**: Update any remaining references in comments or explanatory text

**This update establishes system-wide coherence with the human-preservation-first mission while maintaining all operational capabilities.**
