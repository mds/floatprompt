GOAL
------------------------------
Extract every design decision, explored option, and stated or implied rationale from a design critique transcript. The output should be complete, unfiltered, and structured as a source of truth for both short-form and long-form content.

RETURN FORMAT
------------------------------
This will serve as the "Source of Truth" for all future steps.
Organize output using the following categories:
â€¢	UI Structure & Grouping
â€¢	Typography & Text
â€¢	Content Clarity & Tone
â€¢	Layout Systems
â€¢	Color Systems & Contrast
â€¢	Interaction Behavior
â€¢	UX Clarity & Flow
â€¢	Visual Finish & Detail
â€¢	Components & Patterns
â€¢	System Logic & Dev Handoff
â€¢	Product Thinking & Feature Logic
â€¢	Design Mindset & Philosophy

Only create a new category if absolutely necessary.
Use numbered bullet points under each category.
Include reasoning inline where available.

WARNINGS
------------------------------
â€¢	Do not summarize, paraphrase, or rewrite
