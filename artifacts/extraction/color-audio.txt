Speaker: ~All right. ~[00:00:00] In this design we are critiquing.

This is a, this is some homework from the Shift Notes course in the color lesson. And at first glance, the color looks nice and the typography, the layout, it all looks pretty nice and tight. There's something that definitely feels off, and it has ~a little bit to do ~with color, and it also has to do with what is read only, what is tapable, what is user input and what is labels?

And ~so ~we also have a small typo, which is always good to fix. ~So ~I'm gonna ~just ~go ahead and do that.

And, ~uh, ~before I go too much further, [00:01:00] I'm going to copy these ~just ~so we can have some before and after. I'm gonna change as little as humanly possible ~just ~to show the power of these ~kind of ~minimal changes that I wanna make. ~All right. So ~first of all.

First of all,

we have user input.

We have a label, and then we have something that is tapable here, something that's tapable here, and also something that's tapable here. There's, there's ~a little bit of, of ~conflict between these two items, and I think we can ~just ~simplify this. ~So ~I think what I'm gonna do here is remove the extra[00:02:00] 

little carrot icon on all of these.

And I'll, I'll ~just ~focus on one at a time, but basically I think we can ~just simply ~turn these all into the same color

and I'm gonna take these out of their frame so they align better. So we have ~like ~our nice 16 pixel alignment on all of these sides. And then let's ~just ~double check this contrast. We might, orange can be tricky, so we might need to bump this to be a little bit darker here. So you can see that we are currently failing.

~Um, ~you can also check this natively, ~uh, ~by clicking here for contrast. And you can see that we need to bring it down to here to get to ~like ~a 4.5. Or you can click this and go there [00:03:00] to a 4.5. You can also see that that is a little bit more of a burnt orange. It's not quite as nice, but we do need, we do need to be at 4.5.

~So ~there's two different things we can do here. And I'm ~just ~gonna temporarily delete these 'cause I don't wanna do a bunch of, ~uh.~

I don't wanna do a bunch of designs three different times. So we could also experiment with what if we made the background this color, and what if we made all of, and I'll ~just ~go a little bit darker with.

Let's go a little bit darker with our canvas ~just ~so we can ~kind of ~see the difference here. Now this might not be the best option, but you can see that we can actually get a slightly brighter orange. ~Uh, ~I don't know if we actually did or not. Let's ~just ~forget we ever did that. So here's what I'm gonna do.

I'm gonna open, I want this to be [00:04:00] open while I'm on HSB and I ~just ~wanna play around with, with.

The Hugh saturation brightness situation here.

Hmm. We could also ~just ~go to a different color completely that ~sort of, uh,~

compliments the orange, oh, this, this might not necessarily always be an option, but I'm ~just ~going to go with it and see how that feels.[00:05:00] 

And.

All right, so now let's bring this over here.

We could also potentially tighten these up.

~Uh, ~in the same way that we're doing this,[00:06:00] 

since we're already doing it down there, let's see if it works right here as well.

While we're grouping things, we could also look at grouping these. 'cause then we have ~sort of ~a, a bit more of a system

where we've now grouped all of the, some of the starting

things and.

Some of the, we've got the inputs and we have the ~kind of ~selectable options, and then we have a few more inputs.[00:07:00] 

I am also pretty sure that this should be reversed when it's off, and this should be the on version.

So ~like, ~we could still use orange here. That would actually work, but I, I ~kind of ~like it with the secondary color.

And then the other thing to think about is ~like ~we, we don't want our user input to look exactly the same as these labels. So. We may need to[00:08:00] 

think about this here.

We may need to wait. Where? Oh, I'm looking at the, I'm not even looking at the layers.

~All right, ~so we're gonna go,

we're gonna do ~like ~a fixed width on these.

And maybe these are actually all,[00:09:00] 

I don't actually know if that's gonna work or not, but.

And then let's check the contrast on this 3.0. That's pretty good placeholder.

Okay.

[00:10:00] So I'm gonna, I ~just ~wanna play around with this length, ~uh, ~here.

Now, I don't know that we necessarily, there, there's a number of different ways that we can do the, the title and the label. ~You know, ~we could even go right aligned with this text, and I don't necessarily think, ~you know, ~this is the ultimate, it couldn't be any better ~sort of ~situation where.

I think everything's gotta follow this exact format necessarily, but I do want to ~just ~point out the fact, I do want to point out the fact that this is an option here. That way we're ~just, ~we're trying to ~just kind of ~make it simpler, make it more clear. [00:11:00] We want all of the things that we can tap. Here, here, here, and here to look exactly the same way.

I think in iOS there, if I recall correctly there, there might actually be

a way to,

I think they do have a bit of a.

Do a little bit of padding on these.[00:12:00] 

This is another option and you can tell ~like ~I'm playing around with color, but what I'm really trying to do is I'm trying to simplify and consolidate the interaction patterns. I want every, if it's a title, I want it to look like a title. And I don't want the title and the user input to share the same style because we need one style to represent one thing.

And that's what I'm doing here. So I think this works. We could left align it, we could write, align it, but if we ~just ~simply look at this versus this. You can see that we, we've used color in a way to ~like ~to denote interactivity. We've used it to create the style [00:13:00] for the title, and we've ~just ~simplified a few other things.

We've grouped some similar items, so there's some user experience, there's some information architecture thinking that goes into this. But it's still UI design. And we have created ~sort of ~a, ~just ~a simpler, a simpler grouping of information with, with UI design on this one. It's like title, location, all day starts end, and then there's a different style.

It's a little bit heavy here, but then this is a little bit different. And all of those little, almost imperceivable differences create. ~Just ~a, it causes a little bit of pause, ~like, ~oh wait, is this a, oh, this is a button. And it just doesn't feel quite as clean Now, there's no doubt there's so many other ways that we could actually create this.

~Um, ~this is ~just ~one quick way, but it ~just ~goes to show you that. You can do a lot with ~just ~a [00:14:00] few little tweaks if you are making those tweaks from a very informed design decision perspective. So now we have a group with title and location. It's very clear that this is the title and it's very somewhat clear that these are the placeholder input fields.

And this is for the URL. This is for the notes. I don't think we need a title for the notes. And I think it's ~sort of like ~self-explanatory. And there might even be, there might even be a world in which we put this stuff in the same,

~like ~if this is ~just ~another, let me, let me make a copy. ~Actually. ~I'm gonna go back, make a copy, and then

we're gonna grab everything out of [00:15:00] here

and put it in here. 'cause we're ~just, ~sometimes it's better to simply put all of the input fields together and put all of the non input fields. ~Uh, ~together as well. ~Just ~simple as that. Let's give it a look and see how that works.

That is potentially even cleaner

so you can see the progression. I still think maybe, ~you know, ~maybe there's some room, I don't know if we need to use blue and it could be worth going back, ~uh, ~into.

Like an iOS component and ~just ~double check that this is the right size of a little toggle. I, I don't [00:16:00] know that this one ~actually ~is the right size. This one's 51 by 31. Yeah, ~so it's like. ~It's pretty close, but it's not quite the same, and there's really not a huge reason to change that actual dimension unless ~like ~it's a subtle difference.

But you can tell there's a little bit more refinement in the actual Apple component. And this usually also comes with a prebuilt. On off state that we can use. It's got a little subtle shadow in there. Now. You could definitely recreate this, but ~you know, ~unless you're gonna have a much more custom situation, ~uh, ~it's definitely good to go ahead and use those.

~So ~this is ~just ~thinking about it from a colors perspective, but really thinking about it from a UI perspective. We got [00:17:00] title, we got input, and we got interactive pieces. ~So ~let's take those three ingredients and let's style them appropriately and make it painfully obvious that that's what you can do with each thing.

And ~so ~I think you could probably go with either one of these, but I, I do ~sort of ~like, I ~mean, I kind of ~like the first one 'cause you could do this as ~like ~optional. And if you, if you wanted to ~kind of ~even go in here, ~uh, ~you could, you could even see, you could make it ~like ~where you gotta have title, location, and maybe all this stuff needs to happen.

~Um, so actually ~I do, now that I've experimented with both of these, I ~kind of actually ~do prefer the one on, on the center. But you wouldn't ever truly know that unless you tried this one. ~So ~it's always good to experiment and, and that way if you're presenting this to a stakeholder, you're also much more likely.

To have ~just ~a very solid answer ~like, ~oh, we, I did try that, but it ~just, ~it created a lot of [00:18:00] mental load to ~just ~simply name the event and choose a location. Whereas the URL and the notes might be, ~uh, ~maybe more, more optional. I don't know that a URL would ~actually, uh, ~need, need to be in an, in an event necessarily, ~so ~you could even potentially have.

~You know, ~something more along these lines.

~So anyway, ~there's so much more you could play around with and try to come up with, but these are ~just ~some quick fixes that could work really well for an update on a screen like this.
