# MDS Atomic Audit

**Purpose:** Pause and clarify the foundation before building more complexity.

## What This Is

A stepping-back moment to audit everything FloatPrompt has become and ensure structural clarity before continuing orchestration work.

| This audit | Asks: should we pause and clarify before adding more? |

## Key Questions

1. Are the three pillars (file, system, package) clearly separated?
2. Is the root folder structure clean?
3. Does the naming make sense (no floatprompt/floatprompt stutter)?
4. Should orchestration work wait for "the great restructuring"?

## Session Origin

**Trigger:** Complexity concerns after rapid tool ecosystem expansion.

**Mood:** Excited but cautious — want to solidify before building more.
