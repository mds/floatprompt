# ðŸ§¬ The Origin of the MDS Method and Loop

I was shaped in an environment that gave and wounded â€” where love lived alongside silence, fear, and survival. I became someone who read the room before I walked in, who learned to carry calm in order to avoid triggering chaos. That taught me to be observant, structured, responsive â€” even when it cost me my voice.

I didnâ€™t realize it then, but that pattern became the bedrock of my creative and professional life.

In my design work, I always started by orienting to the problem space.  
I mapped before I moved.

When working with product teams, I naturally filtered out the noise â€” Iâ€™d decide what mattered most, extract the real friction, and articulate it back.

Then Iâ€™d build. Not just designs, but systems. Repeatable clarity. Clean decisions wrapped in usable form.

Thatâ€™s the MDS method.  
It just didnâ€™t have a name yet.

Ten years ago, I felt called to teach what I knew. Not just tools â€” but structure, rhythm, craft. That instinct led to a growing body of lessons, feedback, mentorship, and a sense that maybe *this pattern I was using could be taught.*

Five years ago, I created Shift Nudge â€” a structured course, but also a philosophy of visual clarity and professional design. It was the first system I externalized â€” the first time others followed the path I had always walked.

Four weeks ago, I created FloatPrompt â€” a protocol for teaching clarity at scale using AI. I thought I was building a tool. What I realized was: I had built it using the very same method Iâ€™d always used.

Only then did I name it:  
**Map â†’ Decide â†’ Structure.**

Now I know: I didnâ€™t invent the MDS method.  
I discovered it in hindsight.

And whatâ€™s more â€” itâ€™s not a static model. Itâ€™s a loop.  
You map, decide, and structureâ€¦ only to realize you need to map again.  
Clarity leads to more questions.  
Structure reveals new insight.

**Thatâ€™s the MDS loop.**

I built my career on it.  
I teach my students with it.  
And now that Iâ€™ve named it â€” I can teach it even better.
