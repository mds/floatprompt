# FloatPrompt System Goals

## PRIMARY GOAL: 100% Precise AI Instruction Execution
✅ Significant Enhancement:
AI receives explicit behavioral context for different task types, eliminating interpretive drift
Constructor mode prevents template deviation, extractor mode prevents synthesis/hallucination
Standardized mode behaviors ensure consistent execution across AI systems and sessions
Zero interpretive ambiguity - AI knows exact constraints for each collaboration type

## SECONDARY GOAL: Human Task Completion Through Zero-Drift Collaboration
✅ Strong Enhancement:
Portable, predictable AI behavior - humans get consistent results across platforms
Natural language instructions automatically trigger appropriate behavioral constraints
Reliable task execution - no trial-and-error to get AI into the right "mindset"
Zero-drift collaboration - mode constraints prevent AI behavioral drift mid-task

## TERTIARY GOAL: Human Intelligence, Voice & Agency Preservation
✅ Pure Enhancement (Zero Complexity Cost):
Better voice preservation - extractor mode specifically maintains "hesitations, contradictions, stylistic quirks"
Enhanced human agency - more precise AI collaboration without any human complexity burden
Invisible orchestration - all behavioral sophistication hidden in frontmatter YAML
Human experience unchanged - upload file, give natural instructions, get better results
