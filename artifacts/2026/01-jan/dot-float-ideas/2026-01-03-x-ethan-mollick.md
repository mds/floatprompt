When you see how people use Claude Code/Codex/etc it becomes clear that managing agents is really a management problem

Can you specify goals? Can you provide context? Can you divide up tasks? Can you give feedback?

These are teachable skills. Also UIs need to support management

Using a command line interface built for coding is not the best way to manage dozens of asynchronous tasks over a long term timeline.

A big question for the coming year is whether the major AI labs can rethink the experience to be more suited towards delegation on other tasks.

agree, and these will be very valuable skills going forward

That’s what my entire stack of open source agent tooling is about. I think I’ve largely solved this problem, at least in terms of finding an initial solution that works well at scale for software development. You can read about it here:

(Quoting his own post: As we head into 2026, three skills will become even more important..

1) Clear thinking.
2) Translating thoughts to even clearer writing.
3) Ability to divide and keep multiple work streams running in parallel.

Pair this with a drive to just do things and you’ll be unstoppable.)

100%. I think that’s why clarity of thought and writing will be even more important.

All these problems + human attention cap the total amount of parallelizable agents at around 8-10. we're building https://trysquad.ai/ to bump that number up into the hundreds

Real talk, managing AI is 90% people skills

yeah, exactly, once you zoom out it stops being a model problem and starts looking like management. That’s why we went for CLI with Blackbox multi-agent, it's kinda parallel agents, clear goals, tight context, fast iteration. less babysitting tabs, more actual management. UIs will catch up, but yeah the skill is already teachable.

100%, that’s exactly why I was created. A management tool for AI Agents. Here: https://ai-maestro.23blocks.com .

Sounds like AI is the new middle manager

ive had a hard time utilizing agents
