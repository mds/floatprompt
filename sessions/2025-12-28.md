# Session 2025-12-28

## Summary

Implemented FloatSystem in the FloatPrompt repository. Created the core infrastructure files to make the repo practice what it preaches.

## Context

Previous session (different conversation) created the FloatSystem specifications in `artifacts/`. This session implements those specs in the actual repo structure.

## Activity

- [x] Read all CLAUDE.md files across repo
- [x] Read core documentation (fp.md, mds-method.md, goals.md, principles.md, voice.md)
- [x] Read philosophy files (manifesto.md, orientation.md, discovery.md)
- [x] Read new FloatSystem specs in artifacts/
- [x] Read genesis session handoff (floatsystem-session-2025-12-28.md)
- [x] Created `floatsystem` branch
- [x] Created `system.md` (boot loader)
- [x] Created `index.md` (root navigation)
- [x] Created `sessions/index.md` (session log navigation)
- [x] Created `sessions/2025-12-28.md` (this file)

## Files Created

| File | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `system.md` | Created | Boot loader with structure map and maintenance protocol |
| `index.md` | Created | Root navigation with folder listing |
| `sessions/index.md` | Created | Session log navigation |
| `sessions/2025-12-28.md` | Created | This session log |

## Decisions Made

1. **Branch approach** — Created `floatsystem` branch for restructuring (clean PR later)
2. **Coexistence** — CLAUDE.md files kept for now, can be integrated later
3. **Incremental** — Started with core 4 files, subfolder index.md files come next

## What's Next

Subsequent commits should add:
- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/philosophy/index.md`
- `docs/reference/index.md`
- `context/index.md`
- `dev/index.md`
- `experimental/index.md`
- `artifacts/index.md` (may already exist as CLAUDE.md)
- FloatDoc frontmatter to existing docs

## Handoff Notes

For next session or agent:

1. **Branch is `floatsystem`** — not merged to main yet
2. **Core structure exists** — system.md, index.md, sessions/ are in place
3. **Next task** — Add index.md to each subfolder
4. **Decision needed** — How to handle existing CLAUDE.md files (merge, keep, or convert)
5. **Validation** — Test the penetration sequence with a fresh AI to see if it actually works

## Integrity Status

Current state:
- [x] Root has system.md
- [x] Root has index.md
- [x] sessions/ exists with index.md
- [ ] docs/ needs index.md
- [ ] context/ needs index.md
- [ ] dev/ needs index.md
- [ ] experimental/ needs index.md
- [ ] artifacts/ needs index.md
- [ ] Existing docs need floatdoc frontmatter
