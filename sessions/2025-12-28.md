# Session 2025-12-28

## Summary

Implemented FloatSystem in the FloatPrompt repository. Created core infrastructure and subfolder navigation. Renamed `index.md` → `float.md` for better branding (like CLAUDE.md).

## Context

Previous session (different conversation) created the FloatSystem specifications in `artifacts/`. This session implements those specs in the actual repo structure.

## Activity

- [x] Read all CLAUDE.md files across repo
- [x] Read core documentation (fp.md, mds-method.md, goals.md, principles.md, voice.md)
- [x] Read philosophy files (manifesto.md, orientation.md, discovery.md)
- [x] Read new FloatSystem specs in artifacts/
- [x] Read genesis session handoff (floatsystem-session-2025-12-28.md)
- [x] Created `floatsystem` branch
- [x] Created `system.md` (boot loader)
- [x] Created `float.md` (root navigation)
- [x] Created `sessions/float.md` (session log navigation)
- [x] Created `sessions/2025-12-28.md` (this file)
- [x] Created `docs/float.md`
- [x] Created `docs/philosophy/float.md`
- [x] Created `docs/reference/float.md`
- [x] Created `context/float.md`
- [x] Created `dev/float.md`
- [x] Created `dev/updates/float.md`
- [x] Created `experimental/float.md`
- [x] Created `artifacts/float.md`
- [x] Created `artifacts/2025/float.md`
- [x] Renamed all `index.md` → `float.md` (branding decision)
- [x] Updated all references in system.md and float.md files

## Commits

1. `1dc6d17` — Initial FloatSystem structure (system.md, index.md, sessions/)
2. `101d6cb` — Add index.md to all subfolders
3. (pending) — Rename index.md → float.md

## Decisions Made

1. **Branch approach** — Created `floatsystem` branch for restructuring (clean PR later)
2. **Coexistence** — CLAUDE.md files kept for now, referenced from float.md files
3. **Complete coverage** — Added float.md to all subfolders including dev/updates/
4. **Branding rename** — Changed `index.md` → `float.md` for visibility (like CLAUDE.md)

## Integrity Status

Current state:
- [x] Root has system.md
- [x] Root has float.md
- [x] sessions/ has float.md
- [x] docs/ has float.md
- [x] docs/philosophy/ has float.md
- [x] docs/reference/ has float.md
- [x] context/ has float.md
- [x] dev/ has float.md
- [x] dev/updates/ has float.md
- [x] experimental/ has float.md
- [x] artifacts/ has float.md
- [x] artifacts/2025/ has float.md
- [ ] Existing docs need floatdoc frontmatter (future task)
- [ ] Artifact specs need updating for float.md naming (in progress)

## Handoff Notes

For next session or agent:

1. **Branch is `floatsystem`** — not merged to main yet
2. **All folders have float.md** — full navigation coverage
3. **Naming convention** — `float.md` (not index.md) for FloatSystem navigation
4. **CLAUDE.md files coexist** — referenced but not replaced
5. **Next task** — Add floatdoc frontmatter to existing docs (fp.md, goals.md, etc.)
6. **Validation** — Test the penetration sequence with a fresh AI
