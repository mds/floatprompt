# Session 2025-12-28

## Summary

Implemented FloatSystem in the FloatPrompt repository. Created core infrastructure and subfolder navigation to make the repo practice what it preaches.

- [x] Read philosophy files (manifesto.md, orientation.md, discovery.md)
- [x] Read new FloatSystem specs in artifacts/
- [x] Read genesis session handoff (floatsystem-session-2025-12-28.md)
- [x] Created `floatsystem` branch
- [x] Created `system.md` (boot loader)
- [x] Created `index.md` (root navigation)
- [x] Created `sessions/index.md` (session log navigation)
- [x] Created `sessions/2025-12-28.md` (this file)

## Commits

1. `1dc6d17` — Initial FloatSystem structure (system.md, index.md, sessions/)
2. (pending) — Subfolder index.md files

## Decisions Made

1. **Branch approach** — Created `floatsystem` branch for restructuring (clean PR later)
2. **Coexistence** — CLAUDE.md files kept for now, referenced from index.md files
3. **Complete coverage** — Added index.md to all subfolders including dev/updates/

## Integrity Status

Current state:
- [x] Root has system.md
- [x] Root has index.md
- [x] sessions/ has index.md
- [x] docs/ has index.md
- [x] docs/philosophy/ has index.md
- [x] docs/reference/ has index.md
- [x] context/ has index.md
- [x] dev/ has index.md
- [x] dev/updates/ has index.md
- [x] experimental/ has index.md
- [x] artifacts/ has index.md
- [x] artifacts/2025/ has index.md
- [ ] Existing docs need floatdoc frontmatter (future task)

## Handoff Notes

For next session or agent:

1. **Branch is `floatsystem`** — not merged to main yet
2. **All folders have index.md** — full navigation coverage
3. **CLAUDE.md files coexist** — referenced but not replaced
4. **Next task** — Add floatdoc frontmatter to existing docs (fp.md, goals.md, etc.)
5. **Validation** — Test the penetration sequence with a fresh AI
