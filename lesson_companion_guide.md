# üß≠ Shift Nudge Solo Lesson Companion Guide

This guide exists to help solo creators make world-class lessons ‚Äî consistently, efficiently, and with minimal ambiguity.

---

## üìå PHASE 1 ‚Äî MAP (Pre-Structure)

Use this scaffold to surface all relevant inputs before you begin building:

```md
# Lesson Mapping Worksheet
- Title:  
- Transformation (From ‚Üí To):  
- Audience Pain Point:  
- Concept Being Taught:  
- Core Analogy:  
- Professional Use Case:  
- Demonstration Surface:  
- Common Mistake:  
- Outcome Proof:  
````

---

## üß† PHASE 2 ‚Äî SCRIPTING TAG SETUP

Tag sections of your lesson draft or voiceover script to clarify delivery mode:

| Tag                 | Use                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#read-verbatim`    | Precise phrasing, used for intro, key transitions, or closings |
| `#screen-sync`      | Spoken narration that flows naturally with screen demo         |
| `#b-roll-voiceover` | Overdub or recorded after showing visuals                      |
| `#cutaway-insight`  | Optional inserted moment for depth or visual pattern           |
| `#editor-note`      | Production or editing-specific annotation                      |

‚úÖ Best practice: rehearse all `#read-verbatim` sections twice before recording.

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 3 ‚Äî PRE-RECORD CHECKLIST

Use this before you press record. Skipping this adds production debt.

-

---

## üìÅ FILE & NAMING CONVENTIONS

Use consistent, future-reusable file structures:

- `lesson-[mod#].[les#]-[slug]-map.md`
- `lesson-[mod#].[les#]-[slug]-script.md`
- `lesson-[mod#].[les#]-[slug]-assets/`
- `lesson-[mod#].[les#]-[slug]-final.mov`

Example: `lesson-2.3-visual-intel-map.md`

---

## üìä OPTIONAL SELF-TEST (QA)

Run this after a dry run or draft export:

- Would Sarah Shift find this lesson worth watching?
- Is the transformation clear from start to finish?
- Would a team designer reuse this framework internally?
- Is the demo systematic and repeatable?
- Did the analogy reinforce the concept or distract?

---

## üéôÔ∏è TONE & DELIVERY PRINCIPLES

- Speak to a peer, not a beginner
- Show professionalism through rhythm, not hype
- Use humor sparingly ‚Äî never as filler
- Energy should increase toward payoff

---

## üõ†Ô∏è FUTURE INTEGRATIONS (Post-Solo)

- Shared script format for team use
- QA protocol for alpha review group
- Standard critique rubrics for submitted homework
- Smart lesson tracker + status board

---

**Use this document as your internal runway. It ensures that every lesson you record maintains Shift Nudge quality without requiring reinvention.**
