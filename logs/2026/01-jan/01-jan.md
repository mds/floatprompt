## Decisions

| Date | Topic | Status | Summary |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 2026-01-09 | plugin-architecture | locked | AI uses sqlite3 directly, no CLI layer; single /float command for humans |
| 2026-01-09 | float-capture-naming | locked | Renamed handoff to "capture"; first-run UX offers enrichment, educates on auto-capture |
| 2026-01-09 | permissions-proactive-querying | locked | Accept sqlite3 permission prompts (offer auto-approve); AI proactively queries float.db; skills in skills/ folder |
