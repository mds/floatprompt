## Warnings

**Important limitations and considerations:**

### **Protocol vs Software Understanding**
- **This is not software** - requires joint human-AI execution through conversational co-creation over time
- **Not one-shot generation** - FloatPrompt files emerge naturally from conversation, not form-filling
- **Conversational emergence required** - tools develop through dialogue, not automated creation
- **Human authority maintained** - AI serves human intelligence preservation, not autonomous operation

### **Voice Preservation Requirements**
- **Archaeological precision mandatory** - voice preservation supersedes all other processing instructions
- **Zero interpretation protocol** - extract and structure existing intelligence, never generate or summarize
- **Human recognition required** - AI must preserve exact phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise
- **Sacred principle enforcement** - "First, do not rewrite" takes precedence over AI efficiency or convenience

### **Cross-Platform Dependencies**
- **Platform-specific behavior possible** - while designed for universal compatibility, individual AI systems may have variations
- **Session context limitations** - some platforms may have restrictions on context preservation across sessions
- **Upload file size considerations** - very large FloatPrompt files may encounter platform-specific ingestion limits
- **Feature availability variance** - advanced capabilities depend on underlying AI system sophistication

### **Learning Curve Management**
- **Start simple recommended** - begin with basic functionality before exploring advanced archaeological extraction
- **Complexity scales naturally** - avoid jumping directly to sophisticated workflows without foundational understanding
- **Documentation dependency** - advanced features require understanding of Map → Decide → Structure methodology
- **Human agency responsibility** - users must maintain oversight and decision authority throughout collaboration
