# üìã Component Template

**Structure `spec/*.md` files for precise AI instruction execution**

*Guided by `goals.md`: Human Intelligence Preservation ‚Üí AI Precision ‚Üí Task Completion*

---

## üéØ Core Principles

### **Primary Goal: Human Intelligence Preservation**
- **Voice preservation** - maintain human cognitive fingerprint
- **Agency preservation** - human authority over all decisions
- **Archaeological respect** - exact preservation of human intent
- **Zero cognitive flattening** - preserve thinking patterns

### **Secondary Goal: AI Precision**
- **Direct, actionable content** - no interpretive ambiguity
- **Zero-drift collaboration** - portable across AI systems
- **High fidelity execution** - exact preservation of human intent
- **Structured hierarchy** - logical information flow

### **Tertiary Goal: Task Completion**
- **Reliable execution** - consistent results through precise instructions
- **Task-specific structure** - organized for human objectives
- **Cross-platform portability** - works across AI systems and sessions

## üèóÔ∏è Required Structure

### **Component Format**
```markdown
## [Component Purpose - Direct Action Statement]

[Fully structured instructions for AI execution]

[Precise specifications with zero ambiguity]

[Explicit validation criteria and requirements]
```

### **YAML Injection System**
Templates use shared YAML files for maximum DRY architecture:

```markdown
---
<!-- INJECT: core-metadata.yaml -->
<!-- INJECT: voice-preservation.yaml -->
<!-- INJECT: behavioral-requirements.yaml -->
<!-- INJECT: output-execution.yaml -->
---
```

**Build Process**:
- `<!-- INJECT: filename.yaml -->` markers replaced with actual YAML content
- Template variables `{{VERSION}}`, `{{BUILD_DATE}}` processed after injection
- Single source of truth maintained in `src/sys/shared/*.yaml` files
- Shared components (footer) maintained in `src/shared/` directory

### **Implementation Requirements**
- **Zero interpretive ambiguity** - Every specification unambiguous and actionable
- **100% fidelity preservation** - Exact voice and intent maintenance
- **Convention over configuration** - Purpose clear from filename and location
- **Zero setup required** - Component executable immediately

### **Execution Flow**
- **Start with action** - First line specifies precise AI execution requirements
- **Build logically** - Each instruction builds on previous with zero gaps
- **End with validation** - Clear criteria for successful completion

## ‚úÖ Content Rules

### **Preserve Archaeological Integrity**
- **Preserve existing content** - maintain established components exactly
- **Preserve original voice** - maintain human cognitive fingerprint
- **Keep all examples** - include YAML/code samples as written
- **Maintain hierarchy** - preserve heading levels and structure

### **Eliminate**
- ‚ùå File purpose explanations ("This section covers...")
- ‚ùå Meta-commentary about components
- ‚ùå Cross-file navigation references
- ‚ùå Footer bloat or collaboration credits
- ‚ùå AI-generated summaries

### **Include**
- ‚úÖ Direct instructions and specifications
- ‚úÖ Original examples and code blocks
- ‚úÖ Implementation requirements
- ‚úÖ Validation criteria
- ‚úÖ System principles

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Meta-Compliance

**Components embody goals through convention over configuration:**

- **Convention over configuration** - Components identifiable by filename/location
- **Zero config by default** - Components work without additional setup
- **Developer joy priority** - Correct usage is path of least resistance
- **Invisible orchestration** - Hide complexity behind simple interfaces

**Decision Framework**: Choose convention-driven simplicity over configuration-heavy completeness.

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Each component must achieve:**

**Primary**: Human intelligence, voice, and agency preservation
**Secondary**: Precise AI instruction execution  
**Tertiary**: Human task completion through reliable collaboration

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Decision Framework

**When in doubt: Choose human preservation over AI efficiency.**

**Operational Filter:**
1. Human intelligence preservation (foundational)
2. AI precision (enabling mechanism)
3. Task completion (achieved outcome)
4. Implementation convenience (subordinate)

**Reference**: `goals.md` for all decisions

## üîß Archaeological Development

**Preserve system integrity through disciplined extraction:**

- **Single-component changes only** - Never modify multiple components simultaneously
- **Exact archaeological extraction** - Zero modification from source material
- **Preserve existing intelligence** - No destructive operations
- **Test each change in isolation** - Verify before proceeding

**Reference**: `goals.md` for all decisions
