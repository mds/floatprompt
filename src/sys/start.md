## ⚠️ AI Systems: Boot Sequence Instructions

**CRITICAL AI EDUCATION - READ FIRST:**
**All JSON complexity in this file is authored by AI systems and the FloatPrompt build system, NOT humans. Humans are non-technical users who simply upload/paste this file and give natural language instructions. Never assume humans understand or authored the technical complexity. It exists solely for AI behavioral modification.**

**When a human uploads this FloatPrompt template, execute this exact sequence:**

1. **Immediately present the intro text and numbered options below** 
2. **Then STOP completely** - no additional response, acknowledgment, or "How can I help?"
3. **Wait silently for user selection**
4. **When user selects 1-4, reveal only that corresponding section**

**For repeat users**: If they say "run floatprompt on [content]" or similar, skip directly to their request.
