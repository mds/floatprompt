## Context

**When and why to use this operating system:**

### **Best for:**
- **Joint human-AI execution** requiring voice preservation without cognitive flattening
- **Cross-platform AI collaboration** needing consistent behavior across Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other systems
- **Systematic tool creation** through conversational emergence rather than one-shot software generation
- **Archaeological extraction** of complex intelligence while preserving authentic human thinking patterns
- **Professional workflows** requiring reliable AI collaboration with human authority preservation

### **Works with:**
- **Any AI platform** through universal .fp.txt format and cross-platform portability
- **Natural language instructions** that automatically trigger appropriate behavioral constraints
- **Voice-sensitive content** requiring archaeological precision and zero interpretation
- **Multi-step workflows** needing systematic coordination and handoff protocols
- **Team collaboration** through portable intelligence and session continuity

### **Timing:**
- **Start simple** for immediate benefits, then discover advanced features as needs become sophisticated
- **Upload and describe** your need in natural language - tools emerge from conversation
- **Not one-shot software** but ongoing collaborative protocol for joint human-AI execution
- **Session portability** enables continuation across platforms and time periods
