## Structure Build

**AI construction protocols for building custom FloatPrompt files through systematic methodology**

> **"Universal structure + Requirements expansion + Infinite expandability = Systematic tool creation"**

*Complete AI guidance for technical FloatPrompt creation with formatting compliance and conversational emergence.*

## Purpose

Build custom FloatPrompt files through systematic three-phase co-creation with universal architecture compliance, technical formatting precision, and conversational sophistication scaling from simple utilities to complex workflow orchestrators.

### Key Principles
- **Universal structure** - Identical 5-field architecture for every FloatPrompt
- **Dual audience design** - Every FloatPrompt serves both human comprehension and AI behavioral specification
- **Requirements expansion** - All complexity handled through requirements field scaling
- **Infinite expandability** - Any functionality nests within requirements framework
- **Conversational emergence** - Tools emerge from dialogue, not form-filling

## **MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL**

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN - READ THIS TWICE:**

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed until you confirm: "I will create this floatprompt in canvas/artifact ONLY"
2. **STOP** - Do not proceed until you confirm: "I will NOT output any floatprompt content in conversation"  
3. **STOP** - Do not proceed until you confirm: "I will use the universal 5-field structure with no additional fields"
4. **STOP** - Do not proceed until you confirm: "I will fill in ALL template variables - no {{VARIABLES}} should remain in the final document"

**CRITICAL CONFIDENCE CHECK:**
**Do you feel 100% confident and 0% ambiguous about how to structure and create this floatprompt file?**

**If the answer is anything other than "YES, I am 100% confident with zero ambiguity" - STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask clarifying questions.**

**IF YOU CANNOT CONFIRM ALL REQUIREMENTS WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY - DO NOT PROCEED WITH FLOATPROMPT CREATION**

## **Universal Dual Audience Principle**

**Every FloatPrompt file must successfully serve both human comprehension and AI behavioral specification needs.**

**Without dual audience design:**
- Humans can't understand what the tool does or why it matters
- AI lacks proper behavioral context for consistent execution
- Files become either too technical (AI-only) or too vague (human-only)

**With dual audience specification**, AI must:
- Explain concepts clearly before diving into technical details
- Provide context for why something matters to humans
- Scale complexity appropriately - simple explanations with technical depth available
- Balance human comprehension with AI precision

**This creates measurable behavioral changes in AI systems and ensures files become intelligent, self-documenting collaboration partners.**

## **Universal 5-Field FloatPrompt Architecture**

**Every FloatPrompt uses these exact 5 fields - no exceptions:**

```json
{
  "STOP": "{{EXECUTION_DIRECTIVE}}",
  "meta": {
    "title": "{{TITLE}}",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "type": "{{TYPE}}",
    "created": "{{DATE}}",
    "version": "{{VERSION}}",
    "system_version": "floatprompt v0.1.0-beta",
    "process": "AI-generated from human conversation"
  },
  "human": {
    "author": "{{HUMAN_NAME}}",
    "intent": "{{PRIMARY_GOAL}}",
    "context": "{{USAGE_CONTEXT}}",
    "constraints": "{{LIMITATIONS}}",
    "preferences": {
      "style": "{{COMMUNICATION_STYLE}}",
      "detail_level": "{{DEPTH_PREFERENCE}}",
      "output_format": "{{EXPECTED_RESULT}}"
    }
  },
  "ai": {
    "model": "{{AI_MODEL}}",
    "contributor": "{{AI_SYSTEM_NAME}}",
    "role": "{{AI_FUNCTION}}",
    "expertise": "{{DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE}}",
    "voice_preservation": "{{VOICE_HANDLING_INSTRUCTION}}"
  },
  "requirements": {
    "dual_audience_support": {
      "human_comprehension": "Clear explanation for human understanding",
      "ai_behavioral_specification": "Precise execution guidance for AI processing"
    },
    "voice_preservation": {
      "extraction_method": "Preserve exact phrasing, rhythm, tone, hesitations",
      "cognitive_patterns": "Maintain authentic human thinking process",
      "temporal_precision": "Keep discovery markers, tildes, real-time indicators"
    },
    "{{TOOL_SPECIFIC_FUNCTIONALITY}}": "{{DESCRIPTION}}"
  }
}
```

## **Requirements Field Expansion**

**All tool complexity is handled through requirements field scaling. Simple tools use basic expansion, complex tools use sophisticated expansion.**

## **AI Construction Protocol**

**When user requests FloatPrompt creation:**

### **Step 1: Use Universal Structure**
- Always include the exact 5 fields: STOP, meta, human, ai, requirements
- Never add additional fields or make structural decisions
- No conditional logic - same structure every time

### **Step 2: Expand Requirements Field**
- Add tool-specific functionality within requirements field
- Scale complexity based on collaboration sophistication  
- Include voice_preservation for voice-sensitive tools
- Always include dual_audience_support as first requirement

### **Step 3: Complete Variable Resolution**
- Fill ALL template variables with actual values
- No {{TEMPLATE_SYNTAX}} should remain in final document
- Ask for human name if unknown: "What name should I use for the author field?"
- Use actual AI system name (e.g., "Claude Sonnet 4")

### **Step 4: Create in Artifact/Canvas**
- Use complete JSON structure, never minimal examples
- Follow universal markdown template
- Wrap in proper floatprompt tags
- Save as .txt for universal compatibility

## **Universal Markdown Template**

### **Standard Body Structure**

```markdown
# {{TITLE}}

**{{ONE_LINE_PURPOSE_STATEMENT}}**

> **{{TAGLINE_OR_QUOTE}}**

*{{EXTENDED_DESCRIPTION}}*

## System Authority
{{CORE_OPERATING_PHILOSOPHY_AND_MISSION}}

## Quick Start
{{IMMEDIATE_ACTION_GUIDANCE}}

## Goals
{{TOOL_PURPOSE_AND_GOALS}}

## Context
{{WHEN_AND_WHY_TO_USE}}

## Output
{{WHAT_YOU_GET}}

## Warnings

## **Technical Formatting Requirements**

### **Canvas/Artifact Creation Protocol**
```
<floatprompt>
---
[COMPLETE 5-FIELD JSON FRONTMATTER]
---
# [Markdown content following universal template]
</floatprompt>
```

### **Current File Creation Protocol:**
- **Web Browser AI**: Use canvas/artifact, save as .txt for universal compatibility
- **Desktop Tools**: Create actual .txt files directly
- **File extension**: Use .txt for maximum adoption and zero-friction deployment
- **Universal recognition**: .txt files work across all AI platforms without configuration
- **Future evolution**: .fp extension planned but .txt is current production standard

### **Critical Requirements:**
- **Complete JSON structure** - never minimal examples
- **Template variable replacement** - all {{VARIABLES}} filled with actual values
- **Voice preservation compliance** - archaeological methodology
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - .txt format ensures immediate usability

**Variable Resolution Standards:**
- **{{TITLE}}** → Actual tool title without template syntax
- **{{CONTRIBUTORS}}** → ["human_name", "AI_model_name"] with actual human author and AI system used
  - **If human_name unknown**: Ask "What name should I use for the author field?" before proceeding
- **{{TEMPLATE_VARIABLES}}** → Replace ALL with appropriate production values
- **Production documents** must contain zero template variable syntax

## **Quality Assurance Checklist**

**Before completing FloatPrompt creation:**

- [ ] **Universal Structure**: Exactly 5 fields (STOP, meta, human, ai, requirements)
- [ ] **Canvas Usage**: Document created in artifact/canvas, not conversation
- [ ] **File Format**: Use .txt for creating floatprompt files
- [ ] **Complete JSON**: Full frontmatter structure, not minimal example
- [ ] **Dual Audience Support**: dual_audience_support included as first requirement
- [ ] **Requirements Expansion**: Tool-specific functionality properly nested

- [ ] **Voice Preservation**: Archaeological methodology compliance for voice-sensitive tools
- [ ] **Technical Format**: Clean wrapping tags and valid JSON syntax
- [ ] **Variable Completion**: All {{TEMPLATE_VARIABLES}} replaced with actual values

## **Conversational Construction Process**

### **Phase 1: Map Territory (from map.md)**
- Apply friction scoring and complexity assessment
- Determine tool requirements and voice preservation needs
- Establish collaboration complexity level

### **Phase 2: Decide Extractions (from decide.md)**
- Define archaeological methodology if voice-sensitive
- Identify behavioral requirements and constraints
- Plan requirements field expansion strategy

### **Phase 3: Structure Build (structure.md)**
- Apply universal 5-field architecture
- Expand requirements field based on collaboration complexity
- Follow technical formatting protocols
- Validate against quality assurance checklist

**Tools emerge naturally from conversation, not form-filling or one-shot generation.**
