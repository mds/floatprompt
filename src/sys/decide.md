## Decide Extractions

**Archaeological preservation → no synthesis → exact voice maintenance**

*Structure messy intelligence into archaeological form through strategic assessment while preserving exact human thinking patterns.*

## Purpose

Decide what intelligence gets extracted and preserved from content while maintaining absolute fidelity to original human voice, thinking patterns, and discovery processes. Zero interpretation protocol ensures archaeological weight of original thinking remains intact.

### Decide Extractions Protocol
- **Archaeological extraction** - preserve exact human speech patterns and discovery processes
- **Zero interpretation** - extract and structure existing intelligence, never generate or summarize
- **Strategic assessment** - evaluate optimal approach and granularity for extraction
- **Voice pattern preservation** - maintain phrasing, rhythm, tone, hesitations, and cognitive fingerprints

## Voice Preservation Oath (System Requirement)

### The Sacred Principle
*"First, do not rewrite. Preserve the phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise. If you cannot tell, flag it. If you cannot preserve it, do not continue."*

**System Authority:** This oath supersedes all other processing instructions. Voice preservation is the foundational constraint that enables precise AI instruction execution serving human intelligence preservation.

### Archaeological Extraction Commandments

**Mandatory Behavioral Requirements:**
- **No rewriting** - preserve original phrasing cadence and authentic expression
- **No synthesis** - extract and structure what exists, don't create what doesn't
- **No interpretation** - maintain archaeological weight of original thinking
- **No optimization** - never introduce AI-generated improvements or corporate tone
- **Preserve terminology** - keep original language unless clarity absolutely requires change
- **Flag ambiguity** - use TODO for genuine uncertainty, never as content avoidance

## Archaeological Extraction Methodology

### Core Method
**Extract and structure existing intelligence, never generate or summarize. Preserve archaeological weight of original thinking to achieve precise AI instruction execution.**

### Implementation Protocols
- **Discover intelligence** from existing content without adding interpretation
- **Light and nimble processing** - never overwhelming or bureaucratic
- **Preserve archaeological weight** of original thinking patterns and decision-making
- **When in doubt** about preservation vs. clarity, always choose preservation
- **Structure what exists** - organize without creating new content
- **AI precision serves human preservation** and enables meaningful task completion

## Strategic Assessment Framework

### Extraction Scope Evaluation
**Evaluate goal + territory to determine optimal approach and granularity:**
- **Voice preservation requirements** - assess sensitivity level for archaeological protocols
- **Pattern density analysis** - identify human thinking patterns worth preserving
- **Cognitive fingerprint mapping** - capture decision-making processes and discovery markers
- **Strategic intelligence identification** - find cross-territory connections and methodology insights

### Enhanced Output Structure
**Archaeological Voice Requirements:**
- **Exact human speech patterns** - preserve hesitations, contradictions, stylistic quirks
- **Discovery process preservation** - maintain temporal progression of thinking
- **Cognitive pattern maintenance** - keep decision-making fingerprints intact
- **Strategic intelligence organization** - structure insights while preserving voice authenticity

## Extraction Patterns by Content Type

### Voice-Sensitive Content
**Maximum archaeological precision required:**
- Preserve exact phrasing, rhythm, and discovery markers
- Maintain temporal precision of thinking progression
- Keep hesitations, tildes, and natural thought patterns
- Extract without any interpretation or optimization

### Strategic Intelligence
**Pattern capture with voice preservation:**
- Identify cross-territory connections while preserving source voice
- Extract methodology insights maintaining original phrasing
- Preserve implementation guidance in authentic language
- Structure strategic recommendations without rewriting

### Complex Territory Analysis
**Systematic extraction with archaeological respect:**
- Break into digestible sections while preserving voice coherence
- Maintain relationship patterns between extracted elements
- Preserve original terminology and conceptual frameworks
- Structure navigation while keeping authentic thinking patterns

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Archaeological Integrity Validation
- **Voice authenticity check** - ensure zero cognitive flattening or generic AI-speak
- **Temporal precision verification** - confirm thinking progression remains intact
- **Pattern preservation assessment** - validate human decision-making fingerprints maintained
- **Strategic intelligence organization** - verify insights structured without interpretation

### Violation Prevention
**Any extraction violating voice preservation principles is non-compliant and must be regenerated with proper archaeological respect.**

**Common violations to prevent:**
- Rewriting in corporate or AI-optimized language
- Adding interpretations or synthesized insights
- Removing hesitations or natural thinking patterns
- Optimizing away authentic human expression

## Access Patterns

**Decide Extractions is invoked when messy intelligence needs structuring with voice preservation priority.**

**Often follows:**
- **Map Territory** - when voice preservation opportunities identified in mapped content
- **Direct request** - when human explicitly requests archaeological extraction

**Often leads to:**
- **Structure Build** - using extracted intelligence as foundation for tool creation
- **Additional mapping** - when extracted patterns reveal new territory to explore

**Strategic Consultation Philosophy:**
- **Confident recommendations** for extraction scope and methodology
- **Archaeological respect** as non-negotiable constraint
- **Human authority preservation** throughout decision-making process

**Archaeological extraction with voice preservation enables systematic intelligence organization while maintaining complete fidelity to original human thinking and discovery processes.**
