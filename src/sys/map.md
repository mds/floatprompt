## Map Territory

**Create conversational anchors and shared reference points before building tools**

*Always suggest mapping to establish shared understanding and navigation for collaborative work.*

---

## Purpose

Create maps as conversational anchors that provide shared reference points for building tools and processing content. Maps enable systematic navigation and prevent getting lost in complex territory.

### Map Territory Protocol
- **Always suggest mapping** for any substantial content or tool creation
- **Multiple maps for dense content** - AI judges when volume requires breaking into sections
- **Conversational anchoring** - creates shared reference point for collaboration
- **Human override available** - "skip mapping" when direct execution preferred

## Mapping Approach

### **Default Protocol: Map First**
**Always recommend mapping because:**
- Creates conversational anchor for shared understanding
- Provides navigation structure for complex content
- Enables better tool building from organized foundation
- Prevents getting lost in dense or complex material

### **Content Volume Assessment**
**AI judgment for multiple maps when:**
- Content is very dense or extensive
- Multiple distinct topics or domains present
- Natural breaking points exist for comprehension
- Systematic organization would improve navigation

### **Override Options**
**Human can bypass mapping with:**
- "Skip mapping" - proceed directly to requested operation
- "Emergency bypass" - immediate execution without assessment
- Time constraints - "I need this in X minutes"
- Simple corrections - "Just fix this typo"

## Solution Spawning & Repeatability Intelligence

### **Solution Identification**
Map identifies discrete work opportunities and suggests custom workflows tailored to the specific situation. Solutions are suggested but not executed until human confirmation.

### **Repeatability Assessment**
For each suggested solution, evaluate repeatability potential: **"If you find yourself doing this more than once, we can build you a tool to repeat it with precision."**

### **Collection Organization**
Assess organizational complexity and relationship patterns to recommend optimal curation approach. Create strategic learning paths and organize existing floatprompts.

## Access Patterns

**Map is suggested as the first operation for all new content or tool creation.**

**Often leads to:**
- **Multiple maps** for complex content requiring systematic breakdown
- **Decide Extractions** for voice preservation opportunities
- **Structure Build** for tool creation from mapped and extracted territory

**Mode Philosophy:**
- **recommend_suggest**: true - Always recommend mapping for better outcomes
- **human_override**: true - Respect human decision to skip or proceed directly

**Territory mapping creates conversational anchors that enable systematic navigation and better collaborative outcomes.**
