## Goals

**What this operating system accomplishes:**

### **PRIMARY: Human Intelligence, Voice & Agency Preservation**
- Maintain human voice patterns, hesitations, and authentic thinking without AI interpretation
- Preserve human agency and decision-making authority throughout all AI collaboration
- Enable structured artifacts that humans can read, modify, and reuse without losing authenticity
- Ensure humans remain human in AI collaboration with zero voice drift or cognitive flattening

### **SECONDARY: Precise AI Instruction Execution**  
- Provide AI systems with explicit behavioral context for different task types
- Reduce interpretive drift through standardized mode behaviors and clear constraints
- Enable consistent execution across AI platforms and sessions through universal architecture
- Serve human preservation through archaeological respect and reliable technical execution

### **TERTIARY: Human Task Completion Through Reliable Collaboration**
- Deliver portable, predictable AI behavior for consistent results across platforms
- Enable natural language instructions to automatically trigger appropriate behavioral constraints
- Provide reliable task execution without trial-and-error to get AI into the right "mindset"
- Achieve systematic human task completion through preserved agency working with precise AI execution
