**Structure `spec/*.md` files for 100% precise AI instruction execution**

*Guided by `goals.md`: AI Precision ‚Üí Human Task Completion ‚Üí Intelligence Preservation*

---

## üéØ Core Principles

### **Primary Goal: AI Precision**
- **Direct, actionable content** - no meta-commentary about the file
- **Zero interpretive ambiguity** - clear, unambiguous instructions
- **100% fidelity** - exact preservation of human intent and voice
- **Structured hierarchy** - logical information flow for AI consumption

### **Secondary Goal: Human Task Completion**
- **Zero-drift collaboration** - portable across AI systems and sessions
- **Task-specific structure** - organized for human objectives
- **Reliable execution** - consistent results through precise instructions

### **Tertiary Goal: Intelligence Preservation**
- **Voice preservation** - maintain human cognitive fingerprint
- **Clear section headers** - scannable organization for humans
- **Strategic commenting** - explain complex concepts for understanding

## üèóÔ∏è Required Structure

### **Component Format (AI Precision Optimized)**
```markdown
## [Component Purpose - Direct Action Statement]

[Fully structured instructions for AI execution]

[Precise specifications with zero ambiguity]

[Explicit validation criteria and requirements]
```

### **AI Precision Requirements**
- **Fully structured instructions** - AI receives complete guidance for 100% precision execution
- **Zero interpretive ambiguity** - Every specification unambiguous and actionable
- **Explicit validation criteria** - Clear success/failure measurement included
- **100% fidelity preservation** - Exact voice and intent maintenance guaranteed

### **Next.js-Level Implementation**
- **Convention over configuration** - Structure emerges from content purpose, not template rules
- **Zero setup required** - Component executable immediately upon reading
- **Developer joy priority** - Correct usage is path of least resistance
- **File-based identification** - Purpose clear from filename and location alone

### **Execution Flow**
- **Start with structured action** - First line specifies precise AI execution requirements
- **Build logically** - Each instruction builds on previous with zero gaps
- **End with validation** - Clear criteria for successful task completion

### **Section Guidelines**
- **Direct purpose statement** - what this achieves (not what file contains)  
- **Imperative language** - commands, not descriptions
- **No meta-descriptions** - avoid "This section covers..."

## ‚úÖ Content Rules

### **Maintain Component Integrity**
- **Preserve existing content** - maintain archaeological integrity of established components
- **Preserve original voice** - maintain human cognitive fingerprint
- **Keep all examples** - include YAML/code samples exactly as written
- **Maintain hierarchy** - preserve heading levels and structure

### **What NOT to Include**
- ‚ùå File purpose explanations ("This section covers...")
- ‚ùå Meta-commentary about the component
- ‚ùå Cross-file navigation references ("See other files...")
- ‚ùå Footer bloat or collaboration credits
- ‚ùå AI-generated summaries or interpretations

### **What TO Include**
- ‚úÖ Direct instructions and specifications
- ‚úÖ Original examples and code blocks
- ‚úÖ Implementation requirements
- ‚úÖ Validation criteria from source
- ‚úÖ System principles from source

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Meta-Compliance (Next.js-Level Design)

**Components must embody goals through convention over configuration:**

- **Convention over configuration** - Components identifiable by filename/location only
- **Zero config by default** - Components work without additional setup
- **Developer joy priority** - Make correct usage path of least resistance
- **Invisible orchestration** - Hide complexity behind simple interfaces

**Decision Framework**: Choose convention-driven simplicity over configuration-heavy completeness.

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Each component must achieve:**

**Primary Goal**: 100% precise AI instruction execution
**Secondary Goal**: Human task completion through zero-drift AI collaboration  
**Tertiary Goal**: Human intelligence, voice, and agency preservation

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Decision Framework

**When in doubt: Choose AI precision over human convenience.**

**Operational Filter:**
1. AI precision (non-negotiable foundation)
2. Human task completion (enabled by precision)
3. Intelligence preservation (optimized within constraints)
4. Implementation convenience (subordinate to all goals)

**Reference**: `_goals.md` for all decisions

## üîß Archaeological Development

**Preserve system integrity through disciplined extraction:**

- **Single-component changes only** - Never modify multiple components simultaneously
- **Exact archaeological extraction** - Zero modification from source material
- **Preserve existing intelligence** - No destructive operations
- **Test each change in isolation** - Verify before proceeding

**Reference**: `_goals.md` for all decisions
