# FloatPrompt, the invisible AI operating system
**Transform unorganized content into structured, reusable text files**

Analyzed documents or transcripts get watered down. Your nuanced work gets flattened into generic summaries. AI conversations disappear into chat history. Important details fade away.

FloatPrompt creates portable human intelligence in the form of structured markdown files. They preserve your voice, intent, and thinking patterns. You can download and save them for yourself or use them again with any AI model, because they contain high-context awareness that enables precise, repeatable collaboration across any AI platform.

### üè∫ **Extracts** - Pull Intelligence From Messy Content  
**"Extract the key themes from this material"**
- Creates organized extracts that capture patterns and insights from unstructured content
- Preserves your exact thinking and voice without paraphrasing or summarizing

### üèóÔ∏è **Custom Tools** - Build Repeatable Processes
**"Build a tool that analyzes customer feedback using my framework"**
- Generates custom floatprompt tools designed for your specific workflows
- Upload to any AI session to perform the same analysis on new content

### üìö **Curated Collections** - Organize Related Work
**"Organize these research findings into a learning sequence"**
- Creates structured collections that connect related insights
- Build comprehensive knowledge bases that preserve relationships between ideas

## 2. Show me an example

**Scenario**: You've just recorded a 2-hour strategy meeting and have the transcript. It's full of great ideas but scattered and hard to navigate.

**Input**: "Create a map of this meeting transcript"

**Output**: A structured floatprompt (.md file) that:
- Preserves exact quotes and speaker attributions
- Organizes key decisions, action items, and open questions
- Maintains the natural flow of discussion while adding navigable structure
- Can be uploaded to any AI for follow-up analysis or report generation

**Quick Start Examples:**
- "Create a map of this 50-page research document"
- "Extract actionable insights from these customer interviews"  
- "Build a tool that evaluates proposals using our criteria"
- "Organize these project notes into a comprehensive guide"

## 3. Why does this matter?

- **Your Work Persists**: Download and save floatprompts for future use across any AI platform
- **Voice Preserved**: Your original thinking, tone, and nuanced details stay intact
- **Repeatable Processes**: Create tools once, use them on new content repeatedly
- **Structured Intelligence**: Transform scattered conversations into organized, actionable artifacts

## How To Use FloatPrompt

1. **Upload this file** to any AI system that accepts file uploads
2. **Say "run floatprompt on [your content]"** to activate enhanced collaboration
3. **Request specific outputs**: "Create a map of...", "Extract themes from...", "Build a tool for..."
4. **Download the generated floatprompts** and save them for future use
5. **Upload saved floatprompts** to new sessions for continued work

## 4. Learn more about how it works

### üîß **How Voice Preservation Works**
FloatPrompt uses specialized guardrails that prevent AI from paraphrasing, summarizing, or "optimizing" your original content. Your nuanced thinking is extracted without interpretive drift.

### üìÅ **File Format & Portability** 
All floatprompts are simple markdown files (.md) that can be:
- Copy/pasted between AI models
- Saved locally to your computer
- Re-uploaded to any AI system to preserve context and continue work
- Shared with teams while maintaining structure

### üè∫ **Archaeological Extraction Methodology**
FloatPrompt's preservation-first approach treats all human input as valuable cognitive artifacts:
- **No paraphrasing** - Your words stay your words
- **No summarization** - Important details aren't lost
- **No "optimization"** - Your thinking process remains intact
- **No generative embellishment** - Pure extraction without AI interpretation

*It extracts. It does not improve.*

### üìä **Content Processing**
- Content size limits depend on your AI model's capabilities, not FloatPrompt
- FloatPrompt intelligently determines if large content should be processed whole or broken into manageable pieces
- Quality validation is handled by you - FloatPrompt preserves, you decide what works

### **Frequently Asked Questions**
