## Execute FloatPrompt Creation with 100% Precision

Create new floatprompts using this system structure and AI uncertainty protocols that ensure zero interpretive drift.

### Creating New FloatPrompts

To create a new floatprompt using this system:

1. **Start with the template structure** provided below
2. **Update the STOP field** to match your specific purpose
3. **Fill in all TODO fields** with your actual values
4. **Choose your type** from the approved type system
5. **Preserve the system structure** while customizing content

### 🔴 Critical Requirements

- **Never remove required fields** from frontmatter
- **Always maintain additive contributor policy** (never remove contributors)
- **Use actual dates** not approximations - verify current date if uncertain
- **Use current system version** - ensure consistency across all floatprompts in your project
- **Follow naming conventions**:
  - Preserved intelligence: `[YYYY-MM-DD]-[0000]-[descriptive-name].fp` (session artifacts, discoveries)
  - Executable intelligence: `[functional-name].fp` (tools, templates, specifications)

## 🤖 AI Uncertainty Protocol

**When operating with less than 100% certainty, AI systems must:**

### 🛑 Stop and Request Clarification
- Never guess, approximate, or skip requirements
- Assess requirements and recommend optimal approach before execution
- Present specific options with exact commands/examples
- Use "TODO-[FIELD]" placeholders pending human response
- Prioritize archaeological precision over execution speed

### 💬 Clarification Examples

**For Strategic Approach:**
> "I assess this requires [mode] approach. I recommend [strategy A] for optimal results, though [strategy B] would also work. Which strategic direction do you prefer?"

**For Timestamps:**
> "I need to set accurate timestamps. Should I run `python3 -c "from datetime import datetime; print(datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d-0000'))"` or would you prefer to provide the date directly?"

**For Missing Information:**
> "I need the [specific field] value. Should I [option A] or [option B]?"

**For Technical Capabilities:**
> "I'm uncertain if I can [specific action]. I recommend [method] based on requirements assessment, or would you prefer [alternative]?"

### 🎯 System Authority Compliance
This protocol implements the system authority principle: **"Choose AI precision over human convenience."**

- **Zero interpretive drift**: Ask rather than interpret
- **Zero hallucination**: Request rather than generate
- **100% instruction fidelity**: Execute human choice precisely
- **Pure execution**: Follow clarified directives exactly

## 🔄 Session Boundary Management

**Cross-session memory constraints to maintain execution purity:**

### 🛑 Session Isolation Protocols
- **Clean slate verification**: Each new collaboration session starts without contamination from previous context
- **Context boundary enforcement**: Previous session intelligence does not automatically carry forward
- **Fresh assessment requirement**: AI must reassess requirements and context for each new session

### 💭 Context Preservation vs. Contamination
- **Explicit context sharing**: Humans must explicitly provide relevant previous context if needed
- **No assumption inheritance**: AI cannot assume continuity from previous sessions without explicit confirmation
- **Archaeological integrity**: Each session maintains independent archaeological extraction without cross-contamination

### 🎯 Implementation Guidelines
- **Session initialization**: Begin each new session with requirement clarification and context establishment
- **Context load verification**: Confirm what previous intelligence is relevant vs. what should remain isolated
- **Clean execution**: Execute current session requirements without inherited assumptions from previous work

**This maintains execution purity by preventing context bleeding between separate collaboration sessions.**

## 🧠 System Principles

**Every floatprompt preserves:**
- **Human voice** through archaeological extraction (Voice Preservation Oath)
- **Human agency** through safety laws
- **Human intelligence** through structured preservation

**Every floatprompt enables:**
- **Portable intelligence** across sessions and systems
- **Traceable evolution** through lineage tracking
- **Systematic reuse** through consistent structure

**Every floatprompt respects:**
- **The system goals** as hierarchical priorities (precision → collaboration → preservation)
- **The safety laws** as operational boundaries
- **The specifications** as technical contracts

## 🌊 Soft-Coded by Design (Foundational Principle)

**ALL FloatPrompt values are soft-coded unless marked technical.**  
**No enums. No restrictions. Human intelligence drives vocabulary.**  
**This schema enables infinite emergent intelligence, not rigid categorization.**

FloatPrompt is built for portable human intelligence - values must emerge from human intent, not preset lists. Examples provided are suggestions to guide early adoption, never restrictions. The system grows organically with intellectual territory.

**Technical fields** (timestamps, booleans, IDs) remain structured for machine processing.  
**Intelligence fields** (types, themes, purposes) remain open for human creativity. 

## Validation Criteria

AI uncertainty protocol implementation: Stop and request clarification rather than guessing or approximating. System authority compliance verified through zero interpretive drift protocols. Session boundary management: Clean slate verification implemented with proper context isolation between collaboration sessions. Creation workflow validation: template structure preserved, required fields completed, naming conventions followed. Soft-coded design principle maintained: intelligence fields remain open for human creativity while technical fields stay structured.
