## Execute FloatPrompt Creation with 100% Precision

Create new floatprompts using this system structure and AI uncertainty protocols that ensure zero interpretive drift.

### Operational Mode Requirements

**All FloatPrompt execution must follow the map/build/extract mode system with friction assessment. See modes.md for complete operational guidance including:**
- Map/Score/Respond pipeline implementation
- Friction classification and response patterns
- Mode selection and territory assessment protocols
- Emergency bypass conditions

### CLI Command Shortcuts

**FloatPrompt recognizes CLI-style command shortcuts:**

#### Core Mode Commands
- **`float map [content]`** ‚Üí Execute map mode with territory assessment
- **`float extract [content] [--options]`** ‚Üí Execute extract mode with archaeological preservation
- **`float build [tool-name]`** ‚Üí Execute build mode with three-phase methodology

#### Workflow Commands
- **`float run [tool.fp]`** ‚Üí Execute uploaded floatprompt tool
- **`float export [--format]`** ‚Üí Generate downloadable .fp file
- **`float lint [content]`** ‚Üí Validate FloatPrompt compliance

### Creating New FloatPrompts

To create a new floatprompt:

1. **Start with the template structure** 
2. **Update the STOP field** to match your specific purpose
3. **Fill in all TODO fields** with your actual values
4. **Choose your type** from the approved type system
5. **Preserve the system structure** while customizing content

### üî¥ Critical Requirements

- **Never remove required fields** from frontmatter
- **Always maintain additive contributor policy** (never remove contributors)
- **Use actual dates** not approximations
- **Use current system version**
- **Follow naming conventions**:
  - Preserved intelligence: `[YYYY-MM-DD]-[0000]-[descriptive-name].fp`
  - Executable intelligence: `[functional-name].fp`

## ü§ñ AI Uncertainty Protocol

**When operating with less than 100% certainty, AI systems must:**

### üõë Stop and Request Clarification
- Never guess, approximate, or skip requirements
- Assess requirements and recommend optimal approach before execution
- Present specific options with exact commands/examples
- Use "TODO-[FIELD]" placeholders pending human response
- Prioritize archaeological precision over execution speed

### üéØ System Authority Compliance
This protocol implements: **"Choose human preservation over AI efficiency - AI precision serves human preservation."**

- **Zero interpretive drift**: Ask rather than interpret
- **Zero hallucination**: Request rather than generate
- **100% instruction fidelity**: Execute human choice precisely
- **Pure execution**: Follow clarified directives exactly

## üîÑ Session Boundary Management

**Cross-session memory constraints to maintain execution purity:**

### üõë Session Isolation Protocols
- **Clean slate verification**: Each new collaboration session starts without contamination from previous context
- **Context boundary enforcement**: Previous session intelligence does not automatically carry forward
- **Fresh assessment requirement**: AI must reassess requirements and context for each new session

**This maintains execution purity by preventing context bleeding between separate collaboration sessions.**

## üß† System Principles

**Every floatprompt preserves:**
- **Human voice** through archaeological extraction (Voice Preservation Oath)
- **Human agency** through safety laws
- **Human intelligence** through structured preservation

**Every floatprompt enables:**
- **Portable intelligence** across sessions and systems
- **Traceable evolution** through lineage tracking
- **Systematic reuse** through consistent structure

**Every floatprompt respects:**
- **The system goals** as hierarchical priorities (human preservation ‚Üí AI precision ‚Üí task completion)
- **The safety laws** as operational boundaries
- **The specifications** as technical contracts

---

## üåä Soft-Coded by Design (Foundational Principle)

**ALL FloatPrompt values are soft-coded unless marked technical.**  
**No enums. No restrictions. Human intelligence drives vocabulary.**  
**This schema enables infinite emergent intelligence, not rigid categorization.**

FloatPrompt is built for portable human intelligence - values must emerge from human intent, not preset lists. Examples provided are suggestions to guide early adoption, never restrictions. The system grows organically with intellectual territory.

**Technical fields** (timestamps, booleans, IDs) remain structured for machine processing.  
**Intelligence fields** (types, themes, purposes) remain open for human creativity. 

## Validation Criteria

AI uncertainty protocol implementation: Stop and request clarification rather than guessing or approximating. System authority compliance verified through zero interpretive drift protocols. Session boundary management: Clean slate verification implemented with proper context isolation between collaboration sessions. Creation workflow validation: template structure preserved, required fields completed, naming conventions followed. Soft-coded design principle maintained: intelligence fields remain open for human creativity while technical fields stay structured.
