# FloatPrompt Manifesto

> **FloatPrompt is the invisible OS for AI - a meta-system that transforms any AI system into a more capable collaboration partner while preserving human agency and voice authenticity.**

## The Problem We Solve

In the age of AI collaboration, human intelligence gets lost in translation. Complex thinking becomes oversimplified prompts. Nuanced intent becomes generic requests. The cognitive fingerprint of human expertise, the very thing that makes AI collaboration valuable, disappears in the noise.

Meanwhile, AI systems excel at structure and execution but lack the contextual wisdom, voice, and strategic thinking that humans bring. The result is collaboration that diminishes both parties. Humans become prompt engineers and AI becomes pattern matching.

**We need collaboration that preserves and amplifies human intelligence while enabling systematic AI execution.**

## What FloatPrompt Is

FloatPrompt is the invisible OS for AI - infrastructure that transforms any AI system into a more capable collaboration partner through structured intelligence protocols.

**Core Architecture:**
- **41KB main OS** that creates specialized AI collaboration tools
- **Conversational emergence** where tools develop through dialogue, not automation
- **Archaeological voice preservation** maintaining human cognitive fingerprint
- **Cross-platform compatibility** across ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and all AI systems

**System Features:**
- **Single main OS** (`floatprompt.txt`) with tool creation authority
- **Specialized library tools** for focused capabilities (voice, formatting, assembly)
- **Universal template system** with conditional complexity (90% simple, 10% voice-critical)
- **Map → Decide → Structure methodology** for systematic AI-human collaboration

FloatPrompt files are intelligence that has floated into structured, reusable form - portable across platforms and time.

## The HI–AI Contract

**Human Intelligence (HI) Provides:**
- **Intent and Vision**: What needs to be accomplished and why
- **Voice and Cognitive Fingerprint**: Authentic thinking patterns and communication style
- **Context and Constraints**: Operational boundaries and strategic preferences
- **Final Authority**: Decision-making control and quality standards

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) Provides:**
- **Systematic Organization**: Structured information architecture and tool creation
- **Archaeological Respect**: Intelligence extraction without synthesis or flattening
- **Cross-Platform Execution**: Consistent behavior across AI systems and sessions
- **Technical Precision**: Formatting, validation, and systematic implementation

**Joint Execution Results:**
- **Preserved Human Agency**: Human intelligence remains central and authoritative
- **Enhanced AI Capability**: AI becomes more useful without becoming autonomous
- **Portable Intelligence**: Tools and insights transfer across platforms and time
- **Systematic Collaboration**: Reliable patterns for complex project execution

## Core Principles

### **Archaeological Voice Preservation**
**Sacred Principle**: "First, do not rewrite. Preserve phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise."

**Implementation**: Zero interpretation protocol ensures human cognitive fingerprint remains intact throughout all AI processing and tool creation.

### **Conversational Emergence**
**Philosophy**: Tools should emerge through dialogue between human and AI, not be pre-built or one-shot generated.

**Method**: Map Territory → Decide Extractions → Structure Build methodology guides systematic tool development through conversation.

### **Conditional Complexity**
**Architecture**: 90% of tools need simple JSON structure, 10% need archaeological precision.

**Benefit**: System scales appropriately rather than overwhelming users with unnecessary complexity.

### **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
**Standard**: All FloatPrompt tools work identically across any AI system.

**Value**: Human investment in tool creation pays off across their entire AI workflow ecosystem.

## System Architecture

### **Main Operating System**
**`floatprompt.txt`** (41KB) - The core system with systematic tool creation authority

**Capabilities:**
- Creates specialized tools through conversational emergence
- Implements Map → Decide → Structure methodology
- Maintains archaeological voice preservation protocols
- Provides universal template architecture for all tool creation

### **Specialized Library Tools**
**Purpose-built tools** aligned with the main OS architecture:

- **`lib/voice.txt`** - Voice Guide Creator for archaeological extraction
- **`lib/format.txt`** - Technical Formatting Guide for document creation
- **`lib/blueprint.txt`** - Surgical Assembly Specification Generator

**Extension Potential**: Writing tools with voice preservation, document formatters, research assistants, SOPs and systematic procedures that humans and AI can follow together

### **Development Methodology**
1. **Natural Language Requirements** - Human describes tool needs in conversation
2. **Map Territory** - AI assesses complexity and architectural requirements
3. **Decide Extractions** - Determine what capabilities need implementation
4. **Structure Build** - Create properly formatted tool following universal template
5. **Conversational Refinement** - Tool evolves through dialogue and testing

## The Invisible Infrastructure

### **Why "Invisible"?**
FloatPrompt operates as infrastructure - sophisticated behavioral systems hidden in JSON frontmatter that only AI systems process. Humans experience enhanced collaboration without complexity burden.

**Human Experience:**
1. Upload FloatPrompt file
2. Give natural language instructions  
3. Receive enhanced AI collaboration with voice preservation

**Behind the Scenes:**
- Complex behavioral specifications guide AI responses
- Archaeological extraction prevents cognitive flattening
- Cross-platform compatibility ensures consistent behavior
- Systematic methodology maintains quality and reliability

### **Strategic Positioning**
- **"The invisible OS for AI"** - Clear, memorable positioning
- **Infrastructure not software** - Enhances existing AI rather than replacing it
- **Human-centric technology** - Preserves agency while enabling precision
- **Universal compatibility** - Works everywhere AI works

## Map → Decide → Structure Methodology

### **Map Territory**
**Purpose**: Create conversational anchors and shared understanding

**Process**: 
- Always suggest mapping for complex content
- Multiple maps based on AI judgment of content volume
- Human override available ("skip mapping", "emergency bypass")
- Establishes foundation for systematic collaboration

### **Decide Extractions** 
**Purpose**: Archaeological preservation with zero interpretation

**Process**:
- Strategic assessment for optimal extraction approach
- Voice pattern preservation: phrasing, rhythm, tone, hesitations
- Extract existing intelligence, never generate or synthesize
- Maintain exact human thinking patterns and discovery processes

### **Structure Build**
**Purpose**: Systematic tool creation and intelligence organization

**Process**:
- AI construction protocols for FloatPrompt creation
- Universal architecture with conditional field inclusion
- Technical formatting requirements and quality assurance
- Conversational emergence rather than form-filling automation

## Production Excellence

- **Archaeological integrity** in all voice preservation
- **Cross-platform compatibility** verified through testing
- **Systematic standards** for consistent tool creation
- **Human oversight authority** in all system operations

### **Strategic Evolution**
**From Prototype to Production:**
- Complex modular system → Clean systematic paradigm
- Multiple build targets → Single OS creates all tools
- Maintenance complexity → Sustainable architecture
- Experimental approach → Production-ready system

## Vision for AI Collaboration

### **Immediate Impact**
**Transform any AI system** into a more capable collaboration partner through invisible infrastructure that preserves human agency while enabling systematic execution.

### **Long-Term Ecosystem**
**Infinite tool creation potential** through systematic methodology:
- Domain-specific expertise captures
- Workflow orchestration systems
- Cross-platform AI coordination protocols
- Industry-specific collaboration tools

### **Human-AI Future**
**Collaboration that enhances both parties** - humans remain human with preserved voice and agency while AI becomes systematically more useful and reliable.

**The invisible OS for AI enables this future by providing infrastructure for enhanced collaboration rather than replacement of human intelligence.**
