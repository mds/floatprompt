# CLAUDE.md - Philosophy

Background thinking and origin documents. Read for context on why floatprompt exists.

## Files

**manifesto.md** - The core manifesto. "Start where you left off." Why human intelligence gets lost in AI translation and what floatprompt does about it.

**orientation.md** - System orientation guide. Quick start, architecture overview, core concepts, when to use floatprompt.

**discovery.md** - How floatprompt was discovered. The origin story and evolution of the concept.

**context.md** - Context engineering philosophy. Deep dive into why context structure matters for AI collaboration.

**value.md** - Value proposition. Business benefits, ROI, why this matters beyond technical novelty.

**naming.md** - Naming conventions and decisions. Why things are called what they're called.

## Key Themes

**Human Intelligence Preservation**: AI should amplify human intelligence, not diminish it. Voice, thinking patterns, authentic expression are features, not bugs.

**Portability**: Your AI work should travel with you. No platform lock-in. Pure text files that outlast any company.

**Recognition Before Action**: Never execute until the human sees themselves in the output.

**Archaeological Respect**: First, do not rewrite. Preserve what exists.

## Reading Suggestion

Start with **manifesto.md** for the vision, then **orientation.md** for practical understanding. The others provide depth on specific aspects.
