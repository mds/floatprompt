# FloatPrompt Manifesto

> **"Start where you left off"**

In the age of AI, human intelligence gets lost in translation.

Your brilliant conversations disappear. Your voice gets flattened into generic output. Your context vanishes when you switch platforms. You spend more time re-explaining than creating.

**AI was supposed to amplify human intelligence, not diminish it.**

Human intelligence is sacred. Your voice, your thinking patterns, your authentic expression. These are not bugs to be optimized away. They are features to be preserved.

**Voice preservation**: extracting and structuring human intelligence without interpretation, summary, or AI "improvement."

**Conversational emergence**: tools should develop through dialogue with humans, not be imposed by programmers.

**Start where you left off**: not where the AI thinks you should start.

## The Vision

FloatPrompt is the invisible OS for AI collaboration.

It transforms any AI system into a partner that remembers your voice, preserves your context, and lets you continue exactly where you stopped, whether that's ChatGPT yesterday or Claude tomorrow.

**Your intelligence becomes portable. Your voice travels with your work. Your context never dies.**

## Core Principles

### Recognition Before Action
"Never execute until the human sees themselves in the output. If the AI reflects your messy input back to you in a way that makes you say 'Yes, that's exactly what I meant' - then, and only then, are we ready to act."

### Archaeological Respect
"First, do not rewrite. Preserve phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise. Extract and structure what exists - never generate what doesn't."

### Human Authority
"Humans remain human in AI collaboration. You keep complete decision-making control. AI provides systematic execution, not autonomous action."

### Cross-Platform Freedom
"Your investment in AI collaboration should work everywhere. No platform lock-in. No vendor dependence. Pure text files that outlast any company."

## The Call

- Every day we lose valuable AI work to session endings, platform switches, and context gaps.
- Every day our authentic voice gets transformed into generic AI-speak.
- Every day we restart conversations that should continue.

FloatPrompt gives you the power to start where you left off, preserve your authentic voice, and make your AI work truly portable.

**Your intelligence deserves better than being lost in translation.**
