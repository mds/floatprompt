# FloatPrompt System Orientation

## What is FloatPrompt?

**FloatPrompt transforms any AI system into a more capable collaboration partner** through structured text files that preserve context, voice, and functionality across platforms and time.

**Core Promise:** "Start where you left off" - Your AI conversations, work, and intelligence become portable and persistent.

## Quick Start

**Immediate Action:**

1. **Upload `core/prompt.md`** to any AI system → activate floatprompt creation mode
2. **Say "float [anything]"** → AI creates custom collaboration tools through conversation  
3. **Experience enhanced collaboration** with voice preservation and systematic intelligence

**Universal Compatibility:** Works immediately across ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and all AI systems without installation.

## System Architecture

### **Core Templates:**

**`core/prompt.md` (3KB)** - Universal template and system definition
- Complete floatprompt creation protocol with collaboration model
- Self-referential template that teaches AI how to create new floatprompts
- Comprehensive system context and voice preservation protocols
- Natural language triggers: "float map", "float extract", "float build", "float [anything]"

**`core/os.md` (35KB)** - Full system with guided creation
- Boot sequence, friction scoring, step-by-step methodology
- Best for first-time users, complex tools, when you want more structure

**`core/doc.md`** - FloatDoc tool
- Generates YAML frontmatter for mutual understanding

### **Legacy/Experimental:**
**`experimental/`** - Archive of previous build system
- Preserved for reference and advanced use cases

## Core Concepts

### **Human+AI Collaboration Model**
**Core Principle:** "You are a collaborative assistant using shared context, not autonomous software executing specifications."

FloatPrompt establishes systematic human-AI partnership through:
- **Joint execution** through conversational collaboration
- **Strategic framework application** to human's specific situation
- **Clarifying questions** and proving understanding before acting

### **Archaeological Voice Preservation**
**Sacred Principle:** "First, do not rewrite. Preserve phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise."

FloatPrompt maintains your authentic thinking patterns, communication style, and voice across all AI interactions.

### **Conversational Emergence**
**Natural tool creation through dialogue:**
- **"float map"** - Immediate content territory assessment
- **"float extract"** - Voice preservation with conversational requirements gathering
- **"float build"** - Systematic tool creation through collaborative dialogue
- **"float [anything]"** - Custom floatprompt creation for any use case

### **Cross-Platform Portability**
**Context travels with content** - Upload the same file to any AI system and maintain identical functionality and understanding.

## Goal Hierarchy

**PRIMARY:** Human Intelligence, Voice & Agency Preservation  
**SECONDARY:** Precise AI Instruction Execution  
**TERTIARY:** Human Task Completion Through Reliable Collaboration

*→ See [goals.md](goals.md) for complete goal hierarchy*

## When to Use FloatPrompt

### **High Value:**
- **Context preservation** across sessions and platforms
- **Voice-sensitive work** requiring authentic human expression
- **Cross-platform workflows** needing consistent AI behavior
- **Team collaboration** with shared AI behavioral standards

### **Simple Alternative:**
For basic, one-time AI interactions, standard prompting may be more appropriate.

## Key Benefits

- **"Start where you left off"** - Context preservation across time and platforms
- **Voice authenticity** - Your thinking patterns remain intact
- **Universal compatibility** - Works on every AI platform
- **Systematic collaboration** - Reliable, repeatable AI partnerships
- **Team coordination** - Shared behavioral standards

## Next Steps

**Explore the System:**
- **[Use Cases](../use.md)** - Practical applications and examples
- **[Value Proposition](value.md)** - Business benefits and ROI
- **[Format Specification](../floatprompt.md)** - Technical file format details
- **[MDS Methodology](../mds-method.md)** - Complete collaboration methodology

**Start Simple:** Upload `core/prompt.md` to your preferred AI system and say "float [anything]" to create custom collaboration tools. The system will guide you through enhanced AI partnership naturally.
