# Philosophy

Background thinking and origin documents. Read for context on why FloatPrompt exists.

## Files

| File | Intent | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **manifesto.md** | Core manifesto - why human intelligence gets lost | "Start where you left off." The vision. |
| **orientation.md** | Quick start guide - what FloatPrompt is | Architecture overview, core concepts. |
| **discovery.md** | Document empirical findings | Cognitive benefits research. |
| **context.md** | Explain contextual anchoring | When FloatPrompt adds value vs standard AI. |
| **value.md** | Explain business value | Three-layer architecture, ROI, use cases. |
| **naming.md** | Define naming standards | Capitalization, file extensions. |

## Key Themes

**Human Intelligence Preservation**: AI should amplify human intelligence, not diminish it. Voice, thinking patterns, authentic expression are features, not bugs.

**Portability**: Your AI work should travel with you. No platform lock-in. Pure text files that outlast any company.

**Recognition Before Action**: Never execute until the human sees themselves in the output.

**Archaeological Respect**: First, do not rewrite. Preserve what exists.

## Reading Suggestion

Start with **manifesto.md** for the vision, then **orientation.md** for practical understanding. The others provide depth on specific aspects.
