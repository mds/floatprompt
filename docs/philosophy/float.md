# Philosophy

Background thinking and origin documents. Read for context on why FloatPrompt exists.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **manifesto.md** | The core manifesto. "Start where you left off." Why human intelligence gets lost in AI translation. |
| **orientation.md** | System orientation guide. Quick start, architecture overview, core concepts. |
| **discovery.md** | How FloatPrompt was discovered. The origin story and evolution. |
| **context.md** | Context engineering philosophy. Why context structure matters for AI collaboration. |
| **value.md** | Value proposition. Business benefits, ROI, why this matters. |
| **naming.md** | Naming conventions and decisions. Why things are called what they're called. |

## Key Themes

**Human Intelligence Preservation**: AI should amplify human intelligence, not diminish it. Voice, thinking patterns, authentic expression are features, not bugs.

**Portability**: Your AI work should travel with you. No platform lock-in. Pure text files that outlast any company.

**Recognition Before Action**: Never execute until the human sees themselves in the output.

**Archaeological Respect**: First, do not rewrite. Preserve what exists.

## Reading Suggestion

Start with **manifesto.md** for the vision, then **orientation.md** for practical understanding. The others provide depth on specific aspects.
