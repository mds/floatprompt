# What You Can Build

Floatprompts are AI tools as text files. Here's what people build with them.

## Coaches

**Multi-phase guidance tools that produce structured artifacts.**

A portfolio coach that walks designers through 5 phases—clarifying their target role, selecting projects, planning images, writing descriptions, handling logistics—and outputs a personalized HTML planning document they work from.

A script coach that guides creators through hook strengthening, curiosity gap stretching, and payoff structuring, applying viral frameworks while preserving authentic voice.

## Writers

**Content tools with specific frameworks and voice preservation.**

A shortform script writer that applies the 80/10/10 ratio (hook/suspense/payoff) and outputs scripts under 90 seconds.

A newsletter writer that maintains your phrasing patterns and never produces em-dash-riddled corporate speak.

A thread writer that structures ideas for Twitter/X with specific hook formats and engagement patterns.

## Extractors

**Tools that pull structured intelligence from messy content.**

A design feedback extractor that captures critique patterns from portfolio reviews without flattening the teaching voice.

A meeting intelligence tool that extracts decisions, action items, and key insights while preserving speaker voice and context.

## Assistants

**Specialized helpers with defined personas and workflows.**

A sales assistant with your methodology, objection handling, and follow-up sequences built in.

A vendor communication tool that maintains your professional voice and standard terms.

## Index Files

**Navigation documents for complex projects.**

A master index that maps all assets in a project folder—what's where, what feeds what, what's done and what's next.

Upload it to any AI and it instantly knows your project structure.

## The Pattern

Every floatprompt follows the same pattern:

1. **Define the behavior** (JSON) — persona, interaction style, constraints
2. **Provide the methodology** (Markdown) — frameworks, phases, templates
3. **Specify the output** — what artifact gets produced

Simple tools have minimal JSON and light methodology. Complex tools have detailed behavioral specs and multi-phase processes.

Start with what you need. Build from there.
