# Reference Templates

Template references at three complexity levels. Use these as starting points for building floatprompts.

## Files

| File | Purpose | Size |
|------|---------|------|
| **reference-full.md** | All fields, full structure | Complete |
| **reference-mini.md** | Minimal viable template | Reduced |
| **reference-micro.md** | Absolute minimum | Bare bones |

## When to Use Each

**reference-full.md** — When building complex tools with behavioral specifications, voice preservation requirements, and detailed methodology.

**reference-mini.md** — When building simple tools that need basic structure without full complexity.

**reference-micro.md** — When you need the absolute minimum floatprompt structure. Index files, simple utilities.

## Key Principle

Start minimal. Add complexity only when needed. A simple tool doesn't need full-spec overhead.

All templates use `.md` extension for universal compatibility.
