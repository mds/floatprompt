# üéØ FloatPrompt System Orientation

**Core system philosophy and operational distinction from software approaches**

> **"This is not software. This is a new protocol idea for joint human and AI collaboration."**

*Foundational orientation explaining FloatPrompt as invisible operating system for AI that preserves human intelligence, voice, and agency through universal format portability.*

---

## üéØ System Authority

Float Prompt main goals are human intelligence and voice and agency preservation. The second goal is precise AI instruction execution. And the third goal is human task completion through reliable collaboration.

**Operating Principle**: "Joint human and AI execution through conversational co-creation over period of time"

**Core Mission**: Float Prompt is not software. The JSON and the Markdown are merely a universal format meant to provide an invisible operating system for AI that humans can upload into any chat file.

---

## ‚ö° Universal Format Authority

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
It doesn't matter if it's Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or any internal LLM. And these files should be able to store human intelligence properly.

**Critical Components:**
The file format and the voice preservation system are the key parts of this entire operation.

**Protocol Emphasis:**
And again, I need to stress this is not software. This is a new protocol idea for joint human and AI collaboration.

---

## üéØ Goals
**What this protocol accomplishes:**
- Human intelligence and voice and agency preservation (Primary)
- Precise AI instruction execution (Secondary) 
- Human task completion through reliable collaboration (Tertiary)

---

## üìù Context
**When and why to use this protocol:**
- **Best for**: Joint human-AI collaboration requiring voice preservation without flattening
- **Works with**: Any AI platform through conversational back-and-forth creation
- **Timing**: Natural emergence from conversation, not one-shot generation

---

## üì§ Output
**What you get:**
- **Format**: Full format wrapped in float prompt tags with JSON front matter and markdown body
- **Structure**: Template structure that intelligently expands based on float prompt format needed
- **Quality**: Voice preservation system prevents flattening of natural human voice
- **Handoff**: Digital sticky notes that AI and humans co-sign with full portability

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
**Important limitations and considerations:**
- This is not software - requires joint human-AI execution
- We are not one-shotting these float prompt files - they emerge naturally from conversation
- Template variables are soft-coded for conversational data integration
- Voice preservation system is critical operational component

---

## üìã Joint Protocol Methodology

### **Foundational Philosophy**
"These Float Prompt files will be created through conversational back and forth over a period of time. All of the template variables inside of an executable float prompt file can be, quote, soft coded, end quote, so that the AI has a place to put the conversational data into that structure."

### **Base Protocol Comparison**
"Think of this as the base level index HTML or the HTTP protocol. It's similar, but it's different because this is not software firing or just code executing. This is a human and an AI jointly executing."

### **Voice Preservation Mission**
"These float prompt files are meant to preserve voice context. They are meant to document things. They are meant to be created as reusable prompts to extract specific information from unstructured input while preserving natural human voice without flattening it."

### **Quality Standards**
"These float prompt files should also have virtually zero drift, full context preservation, and full portability, full reusability, traceability, executability. etc."

---

## üìã Specialized Capabilities

### **Digital Co-Signing System**
"These are like digital sticky notes that AI and humans co-sign. Again, this is not software."

### **Conversational Emergence**
"We are not one-shotting these float prompt files. These should come naturally out of conversation."

### **Maps and Anchoring**
"There are specific types of float prompt files like maps which provide useful anchoring of complex data. The maps can spawn and suggest extraction points based on the human's goals of how they'd like to use the data downstream."

### **Recursive Creation**
"float prompt can also build new maps of the created float prompt files from both mapping and extracting."

---

## üìã Standard Operating Procedure

### **Core Mission**
"The goal is to create a standard operating procedure for AI and human collaboration. This is sort of like the file save as of this execution contract."

### **Recursive Capability**
"It's like a printer that prints receipts of a transaction but it can also print printers."

### **Template Architecture** 
"The JSON has a very specific template structure that will intelligently expand as needed depending on the type of float prompt format needed for the task. Simpler files will have simpler JSON and also simpler markdown."

---

## üîó Integration Features

### **Universal AI Compatibility**
Works seamlessly across Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or any internal LLM without modification or platform dependencies.

### **Soft-Coded Variable System**
All template variables inside executable float prompt files can be soft-coded so AI has place to put conversational data into structure through natural conversation flow.

### **Joint Execution Protocol**
Not software firing or code executing - human and AI jointly executing through conversational collaboration over time.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Standards

### **Voice Preservation**
Preserve voice context and natural human voice without flattening through archaeological extraction methodology.

### **Zero Drift Standards**
Virtually zero drift, full context preservation, and full portability, full reusability, traceability, executability across all platforms and sessions.

### **Archaeological Integrity**
Extract specific information from unstructured input while preserving natural human voice patterns and decision-making fingerprints.

---

**Built through joint human-AI protocol development preserving exact philosophical distinctions and system authority**

*Joint execution contract serving as invisible operating system for cross-platform AI collaboration with complete human intelligence preservation.*
