## üéØ System Authority

**Primary Goal**: Human intelligence, voice, and agency preservation through archaeological voice preservation  
**Secondary Goal**: Precise AI instruction execution through systematic behavioral specifications  
**Tertiary Goal**: Human task completion through reliable cross-platform collaboration

**Operating Principle**: "Invisible infrastructure that transforms any AI system into a more capable collaboration partner"

**Core Mission**: FloatPrompt operates as the invisible OS for AI - infrastructure hidden in JSON frontmatter that enhances AI collaboration without complexity burden for humans.

---

## ‚ö° System Paradigm

**Revolutionary Architecture:**
FloatPrompt v0.1.0-beta operates as a meta-system - a single 40KB OS file that creates specialized tools through conversational emergence rather than pre-built utilities.

**Main OS Authority:**
- **`floatprompt.fp.txt`** - The core system with systematic tool creation capability
- **Universal template architecture** with conditional complexity (90% simple, 10% voice-critical)
- **Map ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Structure methodology** for systematic AI-human collaboration
- **Cross-platform compatibility** across ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and all AI systems

**Specialized Library Tools:**
- **`lib/voice.fp.txt`** - Voice preservation and archaeological extraction (12KB)
- **`lib/format.fp.txt`** - Technical formatting and document creation (12KB)
- **`lib/blueprint.fp.txt`** - Surgical assembly specification generation (16KB)

**Tool Creation Process:**
1. Human describes tool requirements in natural language
2. Main OS applies Map ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Structure methodology
3. Tool emerges through conversational development and refinement
4. AI creates properly formatted .fp.txt file following universal template

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
**Important system limitations and considerations:**

### **Infrastructure not Software**
- **Joint human-AI execution required** - FloatPrompt enhances collaboration, doesn't replace human intelligence
- **Conversational emergence essential** - Tools develop through dialogue, not one-shot generation
- **Voice preservation critical** - Archaeological methodology prevents AI cognitive flattening
- **Cross-platform dependency** - Effectiveness depends on AI system capability and compatibility

### **System Requirements**
- **Main OS reference needed** - Specialized tools work best with main FloatPrompt OS for creation guidance
- **Template variable processing** - Soft-coded variables require conversational data integration
- **Human oversight essential** - Final authority and quality validation remain with human users
- **Systematic methodology** - Best results require following Map ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Structure process

### **Decide Extractions**
**Purpose**: Archaeological preservation of human intelligence with zero interpretation

**Implementation:**
- Strategic assessment for optimal extraction approach with voice pattern preservation
- Extract existing intelligence, never generate or synthesize new content
- Maintain exact human thinking patterns, phrasing, rhythm, tone, and hesitations
- Archaeological respect treating human intelligence as valuable artifacts requiring careful preservation

### **Structure Build**
**Purpose**: Systematic tool creation and intelligence organization through conversational emergence

**Implementation:**
