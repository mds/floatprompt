# FloatPrompt System Orientation

## What is FloatPrompt?

**FloatPrompt transforms any AI system into a more capable collaboration partner** through structured text files that preserve context, voice, and functionality across platforms and time.

**Core Promise:** "Start where you left off" - Your AI conversations, work, and intelligence become portable and persistent.

## Quick Start

**Immediate Action:**

1. **Upload `floatprompt-os.txt`** to any AI system → activate systematic collaboration
2. **Describe your need** in natural language → tools emerge through conversation  
3. **Experience enhanced collaboration** with voice preservation and consistency

**Universal Compatibility:** Works immediately across ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and all AI systems without installation.

## System Architecture

### **Two Main Files:**

**`floatprompt.txt` (2KB)** - Universal template for creating individual floatprompt files
- Clean template with variables for quick tool creation
- Perfect for single-purpose AI collaboration tools

**`floatprompt-os.txt` (36KB)** - Complete operating system for advanced collaboration
- Full Map → Decide → Structure methodology
- Archaeological voice preservation protocols
- Systematic tool creation authority

### **Library Tools:**
**`lib/voice.txt`** - Voice preservation specialist  
**`lib/format.txt`** - Technical formatting authority  
**`lib/blueprint.txt`** - Assembly specification generator

## Core Concepts

### **Archaeological Voice Preservation**
**Sacred Principle:** "First, do not rewrite. Preserve phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise."

FloatPrompt maintains your authentic thinking patterns, communication style, and voice across all AI interactions.

### **Map → Decide → Structure Methodology**
**Systematic three-phase process:**
1. **Map Territory** - Establish shared understanding
2. **Decide Extractions** - Archaeological preservation of intelligence  
3. **Structure Build** - Systematic tool creation

### **Cross-Platform Portability**
**Context travels with content** - Upload the same file to any AI system and maintain identical functionality and understanding.

## Goal Hierarchy

**PRIMARY:** Human Intelligence, Voice & Agency Preservation  
**SECONDARY:** Precise AI Instruction Execution  
**TERTIARY:** Human Task Completion Through Reliable Collaboration

## When to Use FloatPrompt

### **High Value:**
- **Context preservation** across sessions and platforms
- **Voice-sensitive work** requiring authentic human expression
- **Cross-platform workflows** needing consistent AI behavior
- **Team collaboration** with shared AI behavioral standards

### **Simple Alternative:**
For basic, one-time AI interactions, standard prompting may be more appropriate.

## Key Benefits

- **"Start where you left off"** - Context preservation across time and platforms
- **Voice authenticity** - Your thinking patterns remain intact
- **Universal compatibility** - Works on every AI platform
- **Systematic collaboration** - Reliable, repeatable AI partnerships
- **Team coordination** - Shared behavioral standards
