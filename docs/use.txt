## Use Case Collection

### Context Preservation
**Problem:** You have a breakthrough conversation with ChatGPT that solves a complex problem, but when the session ends that valuable context just disappears forever.  
**Solution:** FloatPrompt captures your conversation, thinking style, and context in a special text file. Upload this `.txt` file to any AI platform (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and it instantly has your full conversation history and understands exactly how you work together.

**Simple to Advanced:** Start simple for basic context preservation, explore advanced features when you need sophisticated voice preservation and archaeological extraction of complex conversations.

### Knowledge Management
**Problem:** You spend hours researching, brainstorming, and working through complex ideas with AI across multiple conversations. You make real progress, gather valuable insights, and develop solutions. But then you face an impossible choice: either dig through endless conversation threads to find that one brilliant insight from last week, or keep adding to an already-overwhelming conversation that's becoming too long and unfocused to be useful.  
**Solution:** FloatPrompt helps you save your accumulated thinking as clean `.txt` files. Instead of hunting through old conversations or diluting focused threads, you package your valuable work into portable files that preserve context without the clutter. Upload to any AI and instantly restore weeks of progress.

### Cross-Platform Intelligence  
**Problem:** You spend 2 hours getting ChatGPT to understand your project perfectly, then want to try Claude but would have to explain everything again from scratch.  
**Solution:** When you have a great ChatGPT session, FloatPrompt saves it as a `.txt` file containing all your context and methodology. Upload this file to Claude and it immediately understands your full project, thinking style, and where you left off.

**Simple to Advanced:** Simple specification provides universal compatibility across all platforms with straightforward context transfer. Full specification adds sophisticated behavioral specifications that work identically across advanced AI systems.

### Team Knowledge Sharing
**Problem:** You spend weeks training ChatGPT to understand your company's writing style and project requirements, but your teammate has to start from zero with their own AI.  
**Solution:** FloatPrompt creates `.txt` files that contain your complete AI collaboration context including your methodology, preferences, and project understanding. Send this file to teammates and when they upload it to their AI, it knows exactly what you know.

### Session Continuation
**Problem:** You had a productive AI session on Monday working on a report, but by Friday you have to waste 30 minutes re-explaining the whole project just to continue where you left off.  
**Solution:** FloatPrompt helps you save your AI sessions as `.txt` files with full context preservation. Days or weeks later, upload the file to continue your work with zero setup time because the AI remembers everything and picks up exactly where you stopped.

### Voice Preservation  
**Problem:** You spend time crafting the perfect rough notes with your authentic thinking style, but AI turns it into generic corporate-speak that sounds like everyone else.  
**Solution:** You create FloatPrompt voice guide files with specific examples of your writing style, tone preferences, and phrasing patterns. Upload these `.txt` files to any AI session and it immediately understands how to maintain your authentic voice instead of defaulting to generic AI-speak.

**Simple to Advanced:** Simple specification includes basic voice preservation instructions. Full specification offers sophisticated voice guides (`floatprompt-voice.txt`) with archaeological extraction methodology for complex voice preservation across extended workflows.

### Workflow Refinement
**Problem:** You finally get AI to understand your workflow perfectly after multiple conversations, but every new chat means starting over and losing all that progress.  
**Solution:** You save your refined workflows as `.txt` files that contain your perfected methodology and examples. Each time you start a new session, upload your workflow file and AI immediately understands your process without needing to retrain it from scratch.

### Large Content Processing  
**Problem:** Massive files (meeting transcripts, research documents, interview notes) are overwhelming to process coherently and you need to extract key insights without losing important details.  
**Solution:** You upload your large content along with FloatPrompt analysis files that guide AI through systematic processing. First mapping the territory, then extracting themes into organized sections, giving you digestible insights plus the overall story without manual analysis.

### Voice and Style Preservation
**Problem:** When AI summarizes your important conversations or documents, it loses your authentic voice and thinking patterns.  
**Solution:** FloatPrompt uses "archaeological extraction" which preserves exactly how you think and express ideas rather than rewriting in generic AI language. Your unique voice, hesitations, and thinking style stay intact in the organized output.

### Meeting and Event Intelligence
**Problem:** Valuable content from meetings, webinars, or events stays trapped as recordings/transcripts and doesn't become useful.  
**Solution:** Upload your raw meeting transcript or recording notes with FloatPrompt. It systematically extracts key insights, decisions, and action items while preserving important context and speaker voice, giving you organized, searchable intelligence you can actually use.

### Reusable Prompt Templates
**Problem:** You've perfected a prompt sequence that consistently produces great results, but you have to recreate it from scratch every time or hunt through old conversations to copy-paste pieces.  
**Solution:** FloatPrompt lets you package your proven prompt workflows into reusable `.txt` templates. Load the template into any AI session and instantly have your refined methodology, examples, and instructions ready to go for consistent results every time.

**Simple to Advanced:** Simple specification provides straightforward template variables for reusable prompts. Full specification offers complex assembly workflows (`floatprompt-blueprint.txt`) for sophisticated multi-step processes and project coordination.

### Breakthrough Recreation
**Problem:** You sometimes get ChatGPT to function perfectly after a long series of trial-and-error prompts, finding that sweet spot where it finally "gets" what you want. But when you start a new session, you can't reliably recreate that magic and end up fumbling around trying to remember what combination of prompts worked.  
**Solution:** FloatPrompt captures the entire prompt sequence and context that led to your breakthrough moment. Instead of hoping you can recreate the magic, you have the exact recipe saved as a `.txt` file that reliably reproduces your successful AI collaboration every time.

### Platform Insurance
**Problem:** You've invested weeks building up valuable AI collaboration context and refined workflows, but it's all trapped in platforms that could disappear, change, or lock you out at any moment.  
**Solution:** FloatPrompt `.txt` files are your insurance policy. Plain text files that work everywhere, owned by you, preserving months of AI training and collaboration investment that no platform can take away.

### Anti-Corporate Voice Preservation
**Problem:** You want AI to summarize and package your valuable knowledge into organized documents, but the output is riddled with em dashes, robotic corporate tone, and generic phrasing that completely erases how you actually think and communicate.  
**Solution:** You create voice guide `.txt` files with examples of your natural phrasing, writing style, and communication patterns. Upload these guides with your content and AI maintains your authentic voice instead of defaulting to obvious "ChatGPT-speak" that everyone can spot immediately.

### Simple â†’ Advanced Learning Journey
**Problem:** You start with simple prompt organization, but as your AI collaboration becomes more sophisticated, you need advanced voice preservation, complex workflows, and professional-grade behavioral specifications.  
**Solution:** FloatPrompt grows with you - start simple for immediate benefits, then seamlessly discover advanced features when you're ready for sophisticated capabilities. Both specifications use the same `.txt` format, so your existing simple files remain compatible while you gain access to advanced features like archaeological extraction and complex project assembly.

### Strategic Decision Documentation
**Problem:** Your team makes important decisions through messy email threads and scattered conversations, then six months later someone asks "why did we choose this approach?" and nobody can remember the full reasoning or find where it was discussed.  
**Solution:** You use FloatPrompt to systematically document your decision-making process, key factors, and reasoning as you work through complex choices. The structured format helps you organize scattered thinking into clear `.txt` files that stakeholders can reference months later to understand the full strategic context.

**Core vs Pro:** Core handles basic decision documentation. Pro provides advanced discovery metadata and relationship mapping for complex strategic decisions across organizational contexts.

### Quality Control for AI Output
**Problem:** You get ChatGPT to produce something that looks professional and comprehensive, but when you review it carefully, it's missing key nuances, uses the wrong tone, or makes assumptions that change your intended meaning.  
**Solution:** You upload FloatPrompt files that include recognition-before-action instructions, requiring AI to reflect your thinking back to you before generating any output. You verify that AI understands your actual intent and voice before allowing it to proceed, preventing polished-but-wrong results.
