# üîÅ The MDS Method: Recursive Clarity for Complex Work

*The foundational methodology behind FloatPrompt's design*

## AI Summary

The MDS Method is a recursive three-phase loop (Map ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Structure) that provides systematic clarity for complex creative, strategic, and operational work. Originally discovered through course architecture and business strategy applications, this methodology directly influenced FloatPrompt's protocol design through its emphasis on recursive thinking and voice preservation. The method enables scaling from sentence-level to strategy-level applications, providing a "mental GPS" for navigating uncertainty in any domain. Rather than a rigid framework, it's a reusable thinking operating system that reveals where you are in complex work and what comes next, making it foundational to understanding how FloatPrompt achieves reliable structured thinking across AI systems.

## ü§ù Human + AI Process

The MDS Method is **both** a human thinking process **and** an AI execution process. It works for:

**Human Intelligence:**
- Navigating complex creative and strategic work
- Recognizing where you are in unclear situations  
- Making decisions about focus and direction
- Structuring thoughts into actionable formats

**Artificial Intelligence:**
- Processing complex human input systematically
- Avoiding premature structure without proper mapping
- Making explicit decisions about what to preserve vs. transform
- Organizing outputs that maintain human intent and voice

**Joint Execution:**
- Humans use MDS method to clarify intent and context
- AI systems use MDS method to process and structure that input
- Both follow the same recursive loop for reliable collaboration
- The method ensures human and AI stay aligned throughout complex work

This shared cognitive framework is what makes FloatPrompt's human-AI collaboration so effective‚Äîboth parties are operating from the same systematic approach to handling complexity.

## üß† Core Loop Definition

**Map ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Structure**

This is a recursive, fractal loop for clear thinking, teaching, and execution. It mirrors how creative, strategic, and operational work actually flows:

- **Map**: Surface all known terrain, options, constraints, references, emotional state, audience, etc.
- **Decide**: Choose what to keep, cut, highlight, pursue, or sequence, this narrows the focus
- **Structure**: Arrange the selected elements into a teachable, actionable, or buildable format

**Clarity emerges when you know where you are, what to focus on, and how to finish.**

This loop can be used:
- At the macro level (entire course, product, strategy)
- At the micro level (sentence, screen, lesson, headline)
- Across disciplines (instructional design, product, ops, content, decision-making)

It is intentionally non-linear but always directionally useful.

## üîç Recognition Signals

### You're stuck in **Map**
- **You might feel:** Overwhelmed, curious but unfocused, loaded with research or inspiration
- **Common phrases:** "I'm not sure what this is yet." "I'm just gathering right now." "It's still a bit messy."
- **What's happening:** You haven't chosen what matters
- **Trigger forward:** You see enough of the edges to know what's signal

### You **skipped Decide**
- **You might feel:** Tension between options, urgency to reduce scope, pressure of judgment
- **Common phrases:** "I know too much, I need to cut." "What matters most here?" "I can't carry all of this forward."
- **What's happening:** You're Structuring chaos
- **Trigger forward:** You find focus, a "Clarity Lock" moment

### You're **forcing Structure**
- **You might feel:** Relieved by constraint, energized by execution, eager to wrap or refine
- **Common phrases:** "Let's lay this out." "What's the cleanest way to say this?" "This is starting to click."
- **What's happening:** You don't have the full picture yet
- **Trigger forward:** You ship, teach, or step back to Map again

## üèóÔ∏è Fractal Applications

MDS works recursively at every level across different domains:

### Strategy Level
- **Map:** Market landscape, constraints, stakeholder needs
- **Decide:** Priority focus areas, resource allocation, timeline
- **Structure:** Strategic plan, roadmap, execution framework

### Project Level
- **Map:** Requirements, team capabilities, available resources
- **Decide:** Scope boundaries, approach, deliverable types
- **Structure:** Project plan, workflows, milestone structure

### Document Level
- **Map:** Purpose, audience, available information
- **Decide:** Key messages, content hierarchy, format
- **Structure:** Outline, sections, final document

### Sentence Level
- **Map:** What is this sentence doing?
- **Decide:** Keep or cut? Refine or redirect?
- **Structure:** Final phrasing, placement, punctuation

This recursive nesting makes it fractal‚Äîit expands or contracts based on context, maintaining the same logical structure across all scales.

## üåâ How MDS Method Influenced FloatPrompt

FloatPrompt isn't just a format, it's a **repeatable clarity ritual** made stable through the MDS Method.

### Protocol Design Connection
The MDS loop powers every part of FloatPrompt's protocol:

| MDS Phase | FloatPrompt Protocol Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Map**   | Inventory user intent, purpose, content type ‚Üí declare prompt type, intent, audience, system version |
| **Decide**| Narrow required fields, voice settings, tone limits ‚Üí confirm structure, behavior, usage mode |
| **Structure**| Write YAML, structure markdown, wrap in builder.fp fence ‚Üí validate prompt + output syntax |

### Recursive Logic in FloatPrompt
- Each prompt is a full MDS loop
- The YAML is a **Decided structure** from previously mapped needs
- The markdown body is a **Structured output** from a decided purpose
- The entire prompt is wrapped using **Structure phase logic**
- Prompt creation itself is **looped recursively**

**FloatPrompt is structured thinking made portable.** Every floatprompt is an MDS loop and loops are how you teach, build, and evolve with clarity.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Immediate Recognition Practice
Ask yourself: **"Where are we in the loop?"**
- Feeling overwhelmed? ‚Üí You're in Map
- Too many options? ‚Üí You need to Decide
- Can't finish? ‚Üí Check if you truly Decided before Structuring

### Micro-Practices
- **Map pass:** "What's here?" or "What am I reacting to?"
- **Decide checkpoint:** "What's the point?" or "What should I carry forward?"
- **Structure focus:** "What's the cleanest way to output this?"

### Loop Awareness
- You don't always enter at the beginning
- You don't always exit at the end
- You can loop inside loops (lesson inside course, decision inside product)
- Celebrate **Clarity Locks**, signs that you can move forward

### Teaching Others
Use real metaphors and examples:
- **In Design**: "You're trying to build the component without mapping the system."
- **In Writing**: "This Structure is fine, but you skipped Decide."
- **In Strategy**: "We mapped the problem but didn't decide on focus."

## üéØ Final Note

The MDS Method is not a productivity system. It is not a philosophy. It is a reusable **thinking operating system** for people building things with clarity.

This is the canonical loop behind the Shift Nudge teaching system, FloatPrompt itself, and most of the business and product clarity that emerged over time. You don't need 10 systems, you need one that loops.

**If your work feels off, zoom out: Are you Structuring without Mapping? Are you Skipping Decide?**

The loop reveals where you are and clarity flows from location awareness.
