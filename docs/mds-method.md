# MDS Method: Map ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Structure

**Systematic methodology for AI-human collaboration through the FloatPrompt Tool Factory architecture**

## üéØ Core Philosophy

The MDS Method provides systematic framework for joint execution between humans and AI systems through structured collaboration protocols. This methodology is embedded in the FloatPrompt Tool Factory, enabling systematic tool creation and human intelligence preservation.

**Map ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Structure** replaces ad-hoc AI interaction with archaeological methodology that preserves human voice while enabling precise AI execution.

## üó∫Ô∏è Phase 1: Map Territory  

### **Purpose**
Create conversational anchors and establish shared understanding of the intellectual territory before execution.

### **When Applied**
- **Always suggested** for complex content requiring systematic collaboration
- **Multiple maps** based on AI judgment of content volume and complexity
- **Human override available** ("skip mapping", "emergency bypass") for urgent scenarios
- **Foundation establishment** for all Tool Factory creation processes

### **Implementation Protocol**

**Automatic Assessment:**
1. **Content Volume Evaluation** - AI assesses scope and complexity
2. **Territory Recognition** - Identify domain boundaries and requirements  
3. **Mapping Recommendation** - Suggest single or multiple maps based on content analysis
4. **Conversational Anchoring** - Establish shared vocabulary and understanding

**Human Authority:**
- Human can request mapping regardless of AI assessment
- Human can override mapping recommendation for emergency execution
- Final decision on mapping scope remains with human authority

**Output Standards:**
- Clear territory boundaries and scope definition
- Shared vocabulary and conceptual framework
- Foundation for systematic extraction and building processes
- Conversational anchors enabling reliable downstream collaboration

### **Territory Mapping Examples**

**Simple Territory (Single Map):**
- Content analysis projects with clear boundaries
- Tool creation with well-defined requirements
- Documentation with straightforward organization needs

**Complex Territory (Multiple Maps):**
- Large content repositories requiring systematic extraction
- Multi-domain projects needing specialized tool coordination
- Strategic planning requiring territory subdivision for systematic processing

## üè∫ Phase 2: Decide Extractions

### **Purpose**
Archaeological preservation of human intelligence through strategic assessment and exact voice maintenance.

### **Core Principle**
**"Zero interpretation protocol - extract existing intelligence, never generate or synthesize"**

### **Implementation Protocol**

**Archaeological Methodology:**
1. **Strategic Assessment** - Determine optimal extraction approach for voice preservation
2. **Voice Pattern Recognition** - Identify phrasing, rhythm, tone, and cognitive patterns
3. **Intelligence Discovery** - Locate existing insights and thinking patterns in source material
4. **Extraction Planning** - Map specific elements requiring archaeological preservation

**Voice Preservation Standards:**
- **Exact Pattern Maintenance** - Preserve hesitations, contradictions, stylistic quirks
- **Cognitive Fingerprint Protection** - Maintain original thinking patterns and discovery processes
- **Temporal Precision** - Capture decision-making sequences and evolution of thought
- **Archaeological Respect** - Treat human intelligence as valuable artifacts requiring careful preservation

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- ‚ùå Summarization that loses nuance and voice authenticity
- ‚ùå Synthesis creating non-existent connections or interpretations
- ‚ùå Voice flattening through AI rewriting or standardization
- ‚ùå Premature structuring without proper archaeological assessment

### **Extraction Quality Standards**

**Archaeological Integrity Requirements:**
- Original human phrasing preserved exactly as expressed
- Thinking patterns and discovery sequences maintained intact
- Voice characteristics and communication style protected
- Strategic insights preserved without interpretation or modification

**Validation Criteria:**
- Human recognizes their own voice and thinking patterns in extracted material
- Original intent and meaning preserved without AI interpretation overlay
- Cognitive fingerprint remains intact and authentic throughout extraction
- Archaeological weight of original thinking maintained for precise AI instruction execution

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 3: Structure Build

### **Purpose**
Systematic creation of FloatPrompt tools and intelligence organization through conversational emergence.

### **Implementation Framework**

**AI Construction Protocols:**
1. **Universal Template Application** - Follow FloatPrompt Tool Factory architecture standards
2. **Conditional Complexity Assessment** - Determine simple (90%) vs voice-critical (10%) tool requirements
3. **Field Inclusion Logic** - Apply appropriate JSON structure based on tool purpose and complexity
4. **Technical Formatting Compliance** - Ensure cross-platform compatibility and validation standards

**Tool Creation Process:**
```
Human Requirements ‚Üí Territory Mapping ‚Üí Extraction Planning ‚Üí Structure Building
        ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
Natural Language ‚Üí Conversational Anchors ‚Üí Voice Preservation ‚Üí Formatted Tool
```

**Quality Assurance Integration:**
- All tools inherit universal template architecture
- Archaeological voice preservation maintained throughout structure building
- Cross-platform compatibility validated for ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and other AI systems
- Conversational emergence ensures tools develop through dialogue rather than automation

### **Structure Building Standards**

**Universal Template Inheritance:**
```json
{
  "STOP": "Tool purpose and behavioral directive",
  "meta": { /* Universal metadata with dynamic versioning */ },
  "human": { /* Intent, context, constraints, preferences */ },
  "ai": { /* Role, expertise, voice preservation protocol */ },
  "requirements": { /* Tool-specific capabilities and protocols */ },
  "integration": { /* FloatPrompt ecosystem coordination */ }
}
```

**Conditional Complexity Logic:**
- **Simple Tools** (90% of use cases): Core universal fields only
- **Voice-Critical Tools** (10% archaeological mode): Additional execution, task, domain, source fields
- **Expansion Protocol**: Any functionality can be nested within requirements/integration structure

**Technical Implementation:**
- Proper `<floatprompt>...</floatprompt>` wrapper tags for cross-platform recognition
- Template variable processing for dynamic versioning and metadata
- Clean markdown structure following universal template guidelines
- Integration with main FloatPrompt OS for archaeological preservation protocols
