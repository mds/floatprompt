# MDS Method: Map → Decide → Structure

**Systematic methodology for AI-human collaboration through archaeological voice preservation**

> **"Map Territory + Decide Extractions + Structure Build = Systematic intelligence preservation with enhanced collaboration"**

*Complete methodology for joint execution between humans and AI systems through structured collaboration protocols.*

## Purpose

Provide systematic framework for AI-human collaboration that preserves human intelligence while enabling precise AI execution through three-phase workflow: Map → Decide → Structure.

### Core Philosophy
**Replace ad-hoc AI interaction with archaeological methodology** that preserves human voice while enabling systematic tool creation and intelligence organization.

## **MDS Methodology Overview**

### **Map Territory**
**Create conversational anchors** and establish shared understanding before execution
- Always suggest mapping for complex content
- Multiple maps based on content volume and complexity
- Human override available for urgent scenarios
- Foundation for all systematic collaboration

### **Decide Extractions**  
**Archaeological preservation** of human intelligence with zero interpretation protocol
- Extract existing intelligence, never generate or synthesize
- Preserve exact voice patterns, phrasing, rhythm, cognitive fingerprint
- Strategic assessment for optimal extraction approach
- Maintain human thinking patterns and discovery processes

### **Structure Build**
**Systematic tool creation** through conversational emergence and universal architecture
- Apply FloatPrompt universal template with conditional complexity
- Follow technical formatting standards for cross-platform compatibility
- Maintain archaeological voice preservation throughout construction
- Enable systematic intelligence organization and collaboration

## **Phase 1: Map Territory**

### **Implementation Protocol**

**Automatic Assessment:**
1. **Content Volume Evaluation** - AI assesses scope and complexity
2. **Territory Recognition** - Identify domain boundaries and requirements  
3. **Mapping Recommendation** - Suggest single or multiple maps based on analysis
4. **Conversational Anchoring** - Establish shared vocabulary and understanding

**Human Authority:**
- Human can request mapping regardless of AI assessment
- Human can override with "skip mapping" or "emergency bypass"
- Final decision on mapping scope remains with human

**Output Standards:**
- Clear territory boundaries and scope definition
- Shared vocabulary and conceptual framework
- Foundation for systematic extraction and building
- Conversational anchors for reliable collaboration

### **Territory Mapping Examples**

**Simple Territory**: Content analysis, tool creation with clear requirements, straightforward documentation
**Complex Territory**: Large repositories, multi-domain projects, strategic planning requiring subdivision

## **Phase 2: Decide Extractions**

### **Archaeological Methodology**

**Core Principle**: "Zero interpretation protocol - extract existing intelligence, never generate or synthesize"

**Implementation Standards:**
1. **Strategic Assessment** - Determine optimal extraction approach for voice preservation
2. **Voice Pattern Recognition** - Identify phrasing, rhythm, tone, cognitive patterns
3. **Intelligence Discovery** - Locate existing insights in source material
4. **Extraction Planning** - Map elements requiring archaeological preservation

**Voice Preservation Requirements:**
- **Exact Pattern Maintenance** - Preserve hesitations, contradictions, stylistic quirks
- **Cognitive Fingerprint Protection** - Maintain original thinking patterns and discovery processes
- **Temporal Precision** - Capture decision-making sequences and thought evolution
- **Archaeological Respect** - Treat human intelligence as valuable artifacts requiring careful preservation

### **Quality Standards**

**Archaeological Integrity:**
- Original human phrasing preserved exactly as expressed
- Thinking patterns and discovery sequences maintained intact
- Voice characteristics and communication style protected
- Strategic insights preserved without interpretation or modification

**Validation Criteria:**
- Human recognizes their own voice and thinking patterns
- Original intent and meaning preserved without AI overlay
- Cognitive fingerprint remains authentic throughout extraction
- Archaeological weight maintained for precise AI instruction execution

## **Phase 3: Structure Build**

### **Implementation Framework**

**AI Construction Protocols:**
1. **Universal Template Application** - Follow FloatPrompt architecture standards
2. **Conditional Complexity Assessment** - Determine simple (90%) vs voice-critical (10%) requirements
3. **Field Inclusion Logic** - Apply appropriate JSON structure based on purpose
4. **Technical Formatting Compliance** - Ensure cross-platform compatibility

**Tool Creation Process:**
```
Human Requirements → Territory Mapping → Extraction Planning → Structure Building
        ↓                    ↓                ↓                    ↓
Natural Language → Conversational Anchors → Voice Preservation → Formatted Tool
```

**Universal Template Structure:**
```json
{
  "STOP": "Tool purpose and behavioral directive",
  "meta": { /* Universal metadata with dynamic versioning */ },
  "human": { /* Intent, context, constraints, preferences */ },
  "ai": { /* Role, expertise, voice preservation protocol */ },
  "requirements": { 
    "dual_audience_support": { /* Human comprehension + AI specification */ },
    /* Tool-specific capabilities and protocols */
  },
  "integration": { /* FloatPrompt ecosystem coordination */ }
}
```

### **Structure Building Standards**

**Conditional Complexity Logic:**
- **Simple Tools** (90%): Core universal fields only
- **Voice-Critical Tools** (10%): Additional execution, task, domain, source fields
- **Expansion Protocol**: Any functionality nests within requirements/integration

**Quality Assurance:**
- Proper `<floatprompt>...</floatprompt>` wrapper tags
- Template variable processing for dynamic versioning
- Clean markdown structure following universal guidelines
- Integration with FloatPrompt OS for archaeological preservation

## **MDS Integration with FloatPrompt System**

### **Main OS Implementation**
- **`floatprompt.txt`** implements complete MDS methodology as core behavioral system
- **Systematic tool creation** through conversational emergence using MDS process
- **Universal template distribution** ensuring all tools inherit MDS methodology
- **Cross-platform deployment** across ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, all AI systems

### **Conversational Emergence Process**
1. **Map Requirements** - Human describes needs, AI assesses territory and complexity
2. **Decide Capabilities** - Strategic assessment of tool features needing implementation
3. **Structure Implementation** - Create formatted tool following universal architecture
4. **Iterative Refinement** - Tool evolves through continued dialogue and testing

## **Strategic Benefits**

### **Human Intelligence Preservation**
- **Archaeological respect** maintains human cognitive fingerprint throughout processing
- **Voice authenticity** preserved through zero interpretation protocol
- **Human authority** maintained as final decision-maker in all collaboration
- **Cognitive pattern protection** prevents AI flattening or rewriting

### **Systematic AI Enhancement**
- **Predictable collaboration patterns** enable reliable AI behavior across platforms
