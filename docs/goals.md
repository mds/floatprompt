# Goals

FloatPrompt operates with a three-tier goal hierarchy. Each level serves the one above it.

## 1. Human Voice & Agency (Primary)

**The foundational goal that supersedes all others.**

- Preserve authentic thinking patterns, phrasing, and expression
- Humans retain complete decision-making control
- No AI rewriting without explicit permission
- Voice preserved identically across all platforms

*Any feature that compromises voice or agency is rejected regardless of other benefits.*

## 2. Reliable AI Behavior (Secondary)

**Enables consistent tools while serving the primary goal.**

- Systematic behavioral specifications in JSON
- Cross-platform consistency (same behavior on ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor)
- Clear protocols for how AI should act
- Predictable outputs from defined inputs

*Behavioral specs must be portable and reliable while preserving human authority.*

## 3. Useful Artifacts (Tertiary)

**Practical outcomes that result from achieving the first two goals.**

- Tools that guide people through processes
- Structured outputs you can actually use
- Workflows that reduce effort and complexity
- Results that improve over time

*Features must make real work easier, not just theoretically possible.*

## Decision Framework

When building or modifying floatprompts:

1. **Does this preserve voice and agency?** → If no, reject it
2. **Does this improve AI reliability?** → If no, modify it
3. **Does this produce useful output?** → If no, reconsider it

The hierarchy is strict. A feature that improves usefulness but compromises voice is not a feature.
