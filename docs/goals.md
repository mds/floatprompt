# FloatPrompt System Goals

**Clear objectives for human understanding and AI development decisions**

*Three-tier goal hierarchy governing all FloatPrompt development and usage decisions.*

## Core Mission

**Ensure humans remain human in AI collaboration** through systematic preservation of human intelligence, voice, and agency while enabling precise AI instruction execution.

## Goal Hierarchy

FloatPrompt operates with a three-tier goal hierarchy where each level serves specific purposes:

### PRIMARY: Human Intelligence, Voice & Agency Preservation

**The foundational goal that supersedes all others:**

- **Archaeological voice preservation** - Maintain exact human thinking patterns, phrasing, rhythm, and cognitive fingerprint without AI interpretation or rewriting
- **Human authority preservation** - Humans retain complete decision-making control and agency throughout all AI collaboration processes
- **Zero cognitive flattening** - Prevent AI synthesis, summarization, or optimization that alters authentic human expression
- **Cross-platform identity consistency** - Human voice and agency preserved identically across all AI systems and platforms

**Development Rule**: Any feature, decision, or change that compromises human voice preservation or agency is rejected regardless of other benefits.

### SECONDARY: Precise AI Instruction Execution

**Enables reliable AI collaboration while serving primary goal:**

- **Systematic behavioral specifications** - Universal JSON architecture provides explicit AI behavioral context for consistent responses
- **Cross-platform reliability** - Identical AI behavior across ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and all AI systems through portable specifications
- **Conditional complexity scaling** - 90% simple tools, 10% voice-critical tools with appropriate AI behavioral adjustments
- **Archaeological methodology compliance** - AI receives explicit protocols for intelligence extraction without interpretation or generation

**Development Rule**: AI behavioral specifications must be systematic, portable, and reliable while preserving human authority.

### TERTIARY: Human Task Completion Through Reliable Collaboration

**Practical outcomes that result from achieving primary and secondary goals:**

- **Conversational tool creation** - Specialized AI capabilities emerge through natural language dialogue rather than technical configuration
- **Session portability** - Context and functionality preserved across different AI platforms and time periods
- **Natural language interface** - Humans provide instructions in normal language while AI applies systematic behavioral constraints automatically
- **Consistent collaboration results** - Eliminate trial-and-error AI interactions through systematic, repeatable processes

**Development Rule**: Features must reduce human effort and complexity while improving practical collaboration outcomes.

## Decision Framework for Development

When making any FloatPrompt development decision, evaluate in this exact order:

1. **Does this preserve or enhance human voice and agency?** (PRIMARY)
2. **Does this improve systematic AI instruction execution?** (SECONDARY)  
3. **Does this make human task completion more reliable?** (TERTIARY)

**If the answer to #1 is no, the decision is rejected.**
**If the answer to #1 is yes but #2 is no, the decision needs modification.**
**Only if #1 and #2 are yes should #3 be considered.**

## Anti-Patterns

**Never Accept (PRIMARY Violations):**
- AI rewriting human content without explicit permission
- System complexity that burdens human users
- AI autonomy that reduces human decision-making authority

**Fix Before Implementation (SECONDARY Violations):**
- Inconsistent AI behavior across platforms
- Non-systematic behavioral specifications
- Unreliable methodology implementation

**Improve When Possible (TERTIARY Violations):**
- Features that increase human effort
- Tools without practical collaboration value
- Unnecessary architectural complexity

## Success Criteria

**PRIMARY Success**: Humans maintain authentic voice and complete agency in all AI collaborations
**SECONDARY Success**: AI systems execute instructions consistently and systematically across all platforms
**TERTIARY Success**: Human productivity and collaboration quality improve through reliable AI partnership
