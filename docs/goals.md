# Goals

**FloatPrompt System Goals: The invisible OS for AI enabling human intelligence preservation through systematic architecture**

## 🎯 Core Mission

**CORE MISSION**: Ensure humans remain human in AI collaboration with no voice drift, no lost agency, no cognitive flattening

**ENABLING METHOD**: The invisible OS for AI that transforms any AI system into a more capable collaboration partner while preserving human authenticity

## Quick Overview

### PRIMARY GOAL: Human Intelligence, Voice & Agency Preservation
✅ **Archaeological Voice Preservation**: Map → Decide → Structure methodology maintains exact human thinking patterns, phrasing, rhythm, and cognitive fingerprint throughout all AI processing

✅ **Enhanced Human Agency**: System creates specialized capabilities on demand while preserving human authority and decision-making control

✅ **Invisible Infrastructure**: Sophisticated behavioral systems hidden in JSON frontmatter - humans experience enhanced collaboration without complexity burden

✅ **Cross-Platform Portability**: Human investment in voice preservation and tool creation transfers across all AI systems and platforms

✅ **Core Mission Fulfillment**: Ensures humans remain human through archaeological respect and systematic intelligence preservation

### SECONDARY GOAL: Precise AI Instruction Execution  
✅ **Systematic Authority**: 40KB main OS creates specialized tools through conversational emergence, providing systematic AI behavioral specifications

✅ **Universal Template Architecture**: Conditional complexity system (90% simple, 10% voice-critical) enables appropriate AI responses based on task requirements

✅ **Standardized Methodology**: Map → Decide → Structure ensures consistent execution across AI systems, sessions, and platforms

✅ **Archaeological Respect**: AI receives explicit protocols for intelligence extraction without synthesis, hallucination, or cognitive flattening

✅ **Systematic Reliability**: Serves human preservation through predictable, high-fidelity AI collaboration patterns

### TERTIARY GOAL: Human Task Completion Through Reliable Collaboration
✅ **Production-Ready Architecture**: 40KB optimal size, 6-file clean structure, dynamic versioning, and cross-platform validation enable systematic deployment

✅ **Infinite Tool Creation**: Conversational emergence allows specialized tools to develop through dialogue for any domain or use case

✅ **Session Portability**: Context preservation across platforms and time ensures reliable long-term collaboration

✅ **Natural Language Interface**: Humans give instructions in natural language while AI applies systematic behavioral constraints automatically

✅ **Consistent Results**: Systematic paradigm eliminates trial-and-error AI collaboration through methodical capability creation

## 🏗️ Development Decision Framework

**All development decisions must align with the three-tier goal hierarchy:**

### Decision Priority Matrix

1. **Does this preserve human voice and agency?** (PRIMARY)
   - ✅ Maintains archaeological voice preservation
   - ✅ Keeps human authority and decision-making control
   - ✅ Prevents cognitive flattening or AI override

2. **Does this enable precise AI execution?** (SECONDARY)  
   - ✅ Provides systematic behavioral specifications
   - ✅ Maintains cross-platform compatibility
   - ✅ Follows universal template architecture

3. **Does this improve human task completion?** (TERTIARY)
   - ✅ Enhances practical collaboration outcomes
   - ✅ Reduces complexity burden on humans
   - ✅ Enables reliable, repeatable results

### ⚠️ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**❌ PRIMARY VIOLATIONS:**
- Any AI rewriting of human voice without explicit permission
- System complexity that burdens human experience
- AI autonomy that reduces human authority

**❌ SECONDARY VIOLATIONS:**
- Behavioral specifications that vary across platforms
- Tools that don't follow universal template architecture
- Inconsistent methodology implementation

**❌ TERTIARY VIOLATIONS:**
- Features that increase rather than reduce human effort
- Tools that don't provide practical collaboration value
- Architecture that creates maintenance burden

## 🏭 Creation Process

### **Natural Language Tool Development**

**Human-Initiated Process:**
1. **Describe Requirements** - Human explains tool needs in natural language
2. **Territory Mapping** - AI assesses complexity and architectural requirements
3. **Extraction Planning** - Determine what capabilities need implementation
4. **Structure Building** - Create tool following universal template architecture
5. **Conversational Refinement** - Tool evolves through dialogue and testing

### **Universal Template Inheritance**

**All tools inherit core architecture:**
```json
{
  "STOP": "Tool purpose and behavioral directive",
  "meta": { /* Universal metadata fields */ },
  "human": { /* Intent, context, constraints, preferences */ },
  "ai": { /* Role, expertise, voice preservation protocol */ },
  "requirements": { /* Tool-specific capabilities */ },
  "integration": { /* Ecosystem coordination */ }
}
```

**Conditional Complexity Expansion:**
- **Simple tools** (90%): Use core fields only
- **Voice-critical tools** (10%): Add execution, task, domain, source fields

### **Quality Assurance Standards**

**Every tool must:**
- ✅ Follow universal JSON architecture
- ✅ Implement proper FloatPrompt wrapper tags
- ✅ Reference main OS for archaeological preservation protocols
- ✅ Support cross-platform deployment and session portability
- ✅ Maintain voice preservation authority throughout operations

---

## 🎭 MDS Method Implementation

### **Map Territory**
**Goal Alignment**: Establishes shared understanding (PRIMARY + SECONDARY)

**Implementation:**
- Always suggest mapping for complex content
- Multiple maps based on AI judgment of content volume  
- Human override capabilities ("skip mapping", "emergency bypass")
- Creates conversational anchors for systematic collaboration

### **Decide Extractions**
**Goal Alignment**: Archaeological voice preservation (PRIMARY)

**Implementation:**
- Zero interpretation protocol - extract, never generate
- Strategic assessment for optimal extraction approach
- Voice pattern preservation: phrasing, rhythm, tone, hesitations
- Maintain exact human thinking patterns and discovery processes

### **Structure Build** 
**Goal Alignment**: Systematic tool creation (SECONDARY + TERTIARY)

**Implementation:**
- AI construction protocols for FloatPrompt creation
- Universal architecture with conditional field inclusion
- Technical formatting requirements and quality assurance
- Conversational emergence rather than form-filling automation
