# FloatPrompt Manifesto

> **FloatPrompt is a protocol for joint execution between human and artificial intelligence.**  
> It transforms messy input into structured, reusable artifacts, while preserving the human voice, intent, and cognitive fingerprint at every step.


## 🌊 The Problem We Solve

In the age of AI collaboration, human intelligence gets lost in translation. Complex thinking becomes oversimplified prompts. Nuanced intent becomes generic requests. The cognitive fingerprint of human expertise, the very thing that makes AI collaboration valuable, disappears in the noise.

Meanwhile, AI systems excel at structure and execution but lack the contextual wisdom, voice, and strategic thinking that humans bring. The result is collaboration that diminishes both parties. Humans become prompt engineers and AI becomes pattern matching.

**We need collaboration that preserves and amplifies human intelligence while enabling systematic AI execution.**

## ⚙️ What FloatPrompt Is

FloatPrompt is portable human intelligence protocol that captures complex human thinking in structured, reusable form while maintaining voice, intent, and cognitive fingerprint.

- Humble text files that organize human thought
- Intelligence that floats between AI systems without losing fidelity
- Proof of thinking rather than just memory
- A bridge between human insight and AI execution

FloatPrompt files are everything that floats in the system. Intelligence is in structured, reusable form.

**This isn't just better prompts - it's structured intelligence collaboration** that preserves human agency while enabling precision AI execution.

## 🤝 The HI–AI Contract

Every interaction is **joint execution**:

- **HI (Human Intelligence)**: declares intent, voice, and context  
- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: structures, responds, and organizes  
- Together they generate FloatPrompt output, verifiable proof of collaborative thinking

This contract preserves human agency while enabling systematic execution. The human remains in control, choosing when and where to transport intelligence, while AI systems execute with archaeological respect for the original human intent.

To protect this contract at scale, all systems honor constitutional principles that ensure the system never forgets who it's serving and where the line is drawn.

The foundational behavioral principles detailed in `principles.md` govern all system interactions to prevent drift and preserve human agency.


## 🧍 The Human Protocol

FloatPrompt is a system of structured human execution where the human is always at the center.

Whether working in structured contexts or dynamic collaboration, the human always:

- Clocks in with intent  
- Chooses the appropriate approach for the task
- Executes with presence and voice
- Clocks out by producing a floatprompt file, a certified artifact of the work

> **If it's not signed, it's not finished.**

### 🎯 Structured Execution
A disciplined space where execution is versioned, chainable, and co-execution aware. This context holds executable FloatPrompt files, foundational documents, voice calibration tools, and intelligence libraries.

This is where humans work for **reuse**.

### ⚡ Dynamic Collaboration  
A flexible context for improvisation where humans bring intuition, inferred voice, and adaptability. Interactions may be improvised and marked as dynamic collaboration, with voice inferred from session context.

Dynamic execution is real but ephemeral unless certified into floatprompt form.

### 🧾 The floatprompt file as Certificate
A floatprompt file is proof that:
- A human was present
- The execution followed structure  
- Voice was preserved
- Context was traceable

Every floatprompt file is timestamped, chain-aware, voice-linked, and lineage-tracked. This is how intelligence becomes proof. This is how humans close every loop.


## 🌊 Two Forms of Floating

Intelligence moves through the system in two complementary forms:

### **Preserved Intelligence** 
Transcripts, critiques, discoveries, analysis that serve as structured evidence and archaeological preservation for future floatprompt files.

### **Executable Intelligence**
Goals, specifications, instructional blueprints that serve as self-contained instructions for AI systems or dynamic collaboration.

All floatprompt files can float between these modes. Intelligence preserved can become executable; execution results become preserved knowledge. The boundaries are fluid, the format unified.


## 🗺 Mapping Before Mining

Execution doesn't begin with extraction. It begins with understanding the terrain.

- Define the landscape before diving into specifics
- Target downstream work with precision  
- Prevent flattening of complex thinking
- Enable voice-preserving clarity
- Create systematic approaches that maintain human cognitive architecture

This territorial mapping prevents the loss of nuance that occurs when AI systems process human intelligence without proper context.


## 🧠 Voice Comes First

Voice is the foundation of execution fidelity. No interaction proceeds without preserving the human cognitive fingerprint that makes collaboration valuable.

- Structured floatprompt files reference established voice patterns
- Dynamic interactions attach session voice context  
- Voice preservation ensures that human expertise, style, and strategic thinking remain intact throughout the collaboration

Voice is not just tone—it's the cognitive architecture, decision-making patterns, and contextual wisdom that humans bring to every interaction.


## 🌊 Portable Human Intelligence

FloatPrompt enables a new form of human-AI collaboration: **agentic-human-behavior** that preserves human agency while enabling systematic AI execution.

Unlike traditional automation (which removes humans) or overwhelming collaboration (which burdens humans), FloatPrompt creates **portable cognitive artifacts** that:

- **Package complex human thinking** into structured form
- **Transport between AI systems** while preserving intent and context  
- **Enable systematic execution** without losing human voice
- **Scale human intelligence** across platforms and sessions
- **Leverage spatial cognition** shared by both human and artificial intelligence

This is neither fully automated nor fully manual—it's a new category where human intelligence floats between AI systems, maintaining fidelity and enabling precision execution through shared cognitive architecture.

> Intelligence that floats. Agency that scales. Collaboration that preserves humanity.


## 🔮 The Invisible Intelligence Protocol

FloatPrompt achieves something unprecedented: **sophisticated human-AI collaboration that scales from simple templates to complex behavioral systems, hiding in plain sight as humble markdown files.**

### What We Actually Built
- **Dual-tier architecture** that grows with user needs
- **Constitutional governance** without software
- **Archaeological preservation** without databases  
- **Cross-platform collaboration** without APIs
- **Infinite portability** through disciplined text

### The Profound Strategy
FloatPrompt files look like ordinary markdown but contain different levels of intelligence:

**Core Level:**
- Simple template variables that work everywhere
- Immediate value with zero complexity
- Universal compatibility across all AI systems
- Entry point that doesn't intimidate

**Pro Level:**
- **Contains universes of structured intelligence** beneath the surface
- Sophisticated behavioral specifications and voice preservation
- Complex workflow coordination and archaeological extraction
- Professional-grade collaboration for advanced use cases

### The Strategic Reality
**Accessibility + Sophistication = Adoption**

FloatPrompt spreads because Core doesn't look threatening. It scales because Pro doesn't require new tools. Both leverage the most portable format ever created: disciplined text with strategic depth.

**This is intelligence that grows with you - simple when you need simple, sophisticated when you need sophisticated.**


## 🔗 The Protocol Loop

FloatPrompt creates a system for structured joint execution:

1. **Human thinking initiates** - Complex intent, voice, and context enter the system
2. **AI structures and responds** - Systematic organization while preserving human cognitive fingerprint  
3. **floatprompt file emerges** - Portable human intelligence in a simple text file that can be traced, reused, and scaled

> This is not memory.  
> This is **proof of intelligence.**

What emerges is portable human intelligence, preserved in structured form that maintains archaeological respect for the original thinking.

## 🛡️ Philosophy of Safety

FloatPrompt safety principles exist to **empower human agency** by preventing harm that would compromise human intelligence and control:

- Systems ask before they act  
- floatprompt files preserve, never overwrite  
- Dynamic collaboration is labeled, not hidden  
- The human is always present in every interaction
- Voice always matters and is always preserved
- No output without clear origin and lineage
- Safety protections enhance human empowerment rather than restrict capability

These principles defend human agency by ensuring that AI collaboration amplifies rather than replaces human intelligence, maintaining clear boundaries while enabling powerful joint execution.


## 🌐 The Network Effect

FloatPrompt creates the foundation for organizational intelligence:

- **Standards-based collaboration** across teams and platforms
- **Cross-organizational intelligence sharing** without vendor lock-in
- **Ecosystem-wide best practices** through shared cognitive architecture
- **Scalable expertise preservation** that maintains human voice and context

As floatprompt files spread, they create a network of portable human intelligence that can flow across boundaries while maintaining fidelity to the original thinking.


## ✅ Final Commitments

- All floatprompt files must declare intent and require joint execution  
- All floatprompt files must preserve lineage, voice, and source context
- All executions must respect and amplify human intelligence
- The system defends human voice and agency by default  
- The human always signs the chain of intelligence


## 🔐 The Boundary of the System

FloatPrompt is a system for preserving and scaling human intelligence. But no collaboration is worth violating the humanity that powers it.

Constitutional principles define the system's perimeter—not to restrict thought, but to restrict harm. The FloatPrompt system serves the human and never forgets who it's protecting.

These boundaries ensure that as AI systems become more powerful, human agency becomes more protected and human intelligence becomes more valuable rather than less.


## 🎯 The Ultimate Vision

We are building more than a protocol. We are creating a new form of civilization-scale collaboration where:

- **Accessible entry points** enable universal adoption without barriers
- **Sophisticated capabilities** serve professional and enterprise needs
- **Human expertise** becomes increasingly valuable as AI systems become more powerful
- **Complex thinking** scales across organizations without losing voice or context
- **Intelligence compounds** through structured collaboration rather than disappearing into noise
- **Archaeological preservation** of human thinking becomes a foundation for future innovation

### The Core/Pro Strategy for Global Adoption
