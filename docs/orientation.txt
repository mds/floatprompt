**The invisible OS for AI - systematic architecture enabling enhanced human-AI collaboration**

> **"FloatPrompt is the invisible OS for AI that transforms any AI system into a more capable collaboration partner while preserving human agency and voice authenticity."**

*Foundational orientation explaining FloatPrompt system paradigm, architecture, and systematic methodology for enhanced AI collaboration.*

## Purpose

Provide comprehensive introduction to FloatPrompt system capabilities, architecture, and systematic methodology that enables enhanced AI collaboration while preserving human intelligence and agency.

## **System Authority**

**Core Mission**: FloatPrompt operates as the invisible OS for AI - infrastructure hidden in JSON frontmatter that enhances AI collaboration without complexity burden for humans.

**Three-Tier Goal Hierarchy:**
- **PRIMARY**: Human intelligence, voice, and agency preservation through archaeological voice preservation  
- **SECONDARY**: Precise AI instruction execution through systematic behavioral specifications  
- **TERTIARY**: Human task completion through reliable cross-platform collaboration

**Operating Principle**: "Invisible infrastructure that transforms any AI system into a more capable collaboration partner"

## **System Paradigm**

### **Revolutionary Architecture**
FloatPrompt v0.1.0-beta operates as a meta-system - a single 43KB OS file that creates specialized tools through conversational emergence rather than pre-built utilities.

### **Main OS Authority**
- **`floatprompt.txt`** - The core 43KB system with systematic tool creation capability
- **Universal template architecture** with conditional complexity (90% simple, 10% voice-critical)
- **Map → Decide → Structure methodology** for systematic AI-human collaboration
- **Cross-platform compatibility** across ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and all AI systems

### **Specialized Library Tools**
- **`lib/voice.txt`** - Voice preservation and archaeological extraction (12KB)
- **`lib/format.txt`** - Technical formatting and document creation (12KB)
- **`lib/blueprint.txt`** - Surgical assembly specification generation (16KB)

### **Tool Creation Process**
1. Human describes tool requirements in natural language
