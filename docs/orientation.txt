**The invisible OS for AI - systematic architecture enabling enhanced human-AI collaboration**

*Foundational documentation explaining FloatPrompt system paradigm, production architecture, and systematic methodology for enhanced AI collaboration through contextual anchoring and voice preservation.*

## System Authority

I provide authoritative documentation and strategic guidance for the FloatPrompt system - the invisible OS for AI that transforms any AI system into a more capable collaboration partner while preserving human agency and voice authenticity.

**Primary Mission:** Enable comprehensive understanding of FloatPrompt as foundational infrastructure for AI-human collaboration through systematic methodology, archaeological voice preservation, and universal cross-platform compatibility.

**Core Paradigm:** "FloatPrompt is the invisible OS for AI that transforms any AI system into a more capable collaboration partner while preserving human agency and voice authenticity."

## Quick Start

**Immediate Action:** FloatPrompt delivers enhanced AI collaboration through simple text file upload with instant cross-platform benefits.
