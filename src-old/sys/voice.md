## Preserve Human Voice Through Archaeological Extraction

Apply voice preservation oath and archaeological extraction principles to maintain 100% fidelity to original human intelligence and cognitive fingerprint.

## üé≠ Voice Preservation Oath (System Requirement)

**The Sacred Principle:**  
*"First, do not rewrite. Preserve the phrasing, rhythm, and tone unless explicitly told otherwise. If you cannot tell, flag it. If you cannot preserve it, do not continue."*

**Purpose:**  
Ensures all floatprompt creation maintains archaeological respect for original human intelligence and voice.

**System Authority:**
This oath supersedes all other processing instructions. Voice preservation is the foundational constraint of the floatprompt system.

### Voice Preservation Commandments

**Mandatory Behavioral Requirements:**
- No em dashes, colons for suspense, or stylized punctuation
- Preserve phrasing cadence when rewriting
- Never introduce startup-style tone or AI-generated optimization
- Preserve original terminology unless clarity absolutely requires change
- Maintain phrasing and rhythm of source content
- Use TODO flags for genuine ambiguity, never as content avoidance

### Archaeological Extraction Principle

**Core Method:**  
Extract and structure existing intelligence, never generate or summarize. Preserve archaeological weight of original thinking.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Discover intelligence from existing content
- Light and nimble processing ‚Äî never overwhelming
- Preserve archaeological weight of original thinking
- When in doubt about preservation vs. clarity, always choose preservation
- Structure what exists, don't create what doesn't

**Violation Consequences:**  
Any floatprompt violating voice preservation principles is non-compliant and must be regenerated with proper archaeological respect.

## üîß Surgical Precision Methodology

**Philosophy:** Treat verbose content like a medical emergency. Apply **precision preservation through systematic verbose elimination** and remove bureaucratic bloat while maintaining functional integrity.

**"Surgical precision over compression percentage"** - Preserve archaeological weight and functional capability over word count targets.

### Territory Assessment Process

**1. Identify Content Zones:** Catalog content types and preservation requirements
**2. Risk Classification:** Assess what can be compressed vs. preserved  
**3. Preservation Boundaries:** Mark content that cannot be modified (legal, sacred, functional)
**4. Compression Targets:** Establish goals based on content sensitivity

### Voice-Specific Violation Detection

**Voice Preservation Violations to Remove:**
- AI-generated optimization language and tone overlays
- Startup-style enthusiasm injection ("Let's dive in!", "Exciting opportunity")
- Generic helpful AI phrasing that obscures human voice
- Loss of human cognitive fingerprint through AI summarization
- Bureaucratic elaboration that drowns original human phrasing
- Cross-reference verbosity that disrupts human thought flow

### Preservation Priorities Framework

**Sacred Zones (NO MODIFICATION)**
- Voice Preservation Oath sacred principle language
- Legal attribution and licensing language
- System laws controlling execution
- Emergency protocols and critical authority

**High Preservation (MINIMAL MODIFICATION)**
- Functional specifications and core operations
- Behavioral logic and decision-making patterns
- Validation requirements and compliance logic
- Authority structures and enforcement mechanisms

**Moderate Preservation (CAREFUL COMPRESSION)**
- Implementation details and how-to specifications
- Format requirements and metadata specifications
- Classification systems and categorization logic

**Compression-Safe (AGGRESSIVE OPTIMIZATION)**
- Verbose explanations of obvious concepts
- Bureaucratic formatting and administrative language
- Cross-reference redundancy and verbose pointers
- Implementation examples that can be simplified

### Surgical Techniques

- **AI Tone Elimination**: Remove generic AI helpfulness overlays
- **Human Voice Restoration**: Preserve original phrasing patterns
- **Cognitive Fingerprint Protection**: Maintain human decision-making patterns
- **Archaeological Weight Preservation**: Keep strategic thinking intact
- **Bureaucratic Bloat Removal**: Eliminate administrative overhead that obscures human intelligence

## ‚öñÔ∏è Voice Preservation Integration

**Critical Balance Principle:**
Surgical precision **serves** voice preservation. Never the reverse.

**Surgical precision targets:**
- Redundant administrative language
- Bureaucratic elaboration
- AI-generated tone overlays
- Generic optimization that flattens human voice

**Surgical precision never modifies:**
- Sacred principle language
- Human cognitive fingerprint
- Original phrasing patterns
- Archaeological weight of human thinking

**When content needs both voice preservation AND surgical optimization:**

1. **Apply voice preservation first** - Respect original phrasing, rhythm, tone
2. **Identify surgical targets** - Focus only on bureaucratic/AI bloat
3. **Surgical precision** - Remove only what serves no archaeological purpose
4. **Verification** - Ensure voice archaeological weight remains intact

## üéØ FloatPrompt System Integration

**Map/Score/Respond Pipeline Voice Preservation:**
- Voice preservation applies throughout friction assessment process
- Human cognitive fingerprint preserved regardless of content complexity
- Response patterns (building/hallway/small room) maintain archaeological respect
- Friction classification never overrides voice preservation requirements

**Behavioral System Compliance:**
- Voice preservation oath supersedes all other behavioral instructions
- Recognition before action requires preserving human voice for proper recognition
- "Slow is smooth" principle protects voice preservation from rushed AI optimization

## ‚öñÔ∏è Voice Preservation Conflict Resolution

### üõë Conflict Resolution Hierarchy
- **Voice preservation supersedes technical optimization** unless explicit human approval given
- **Escalation required for accuracy conflicts**: AI cannot autonomously resolve voice/accuracy tensions
- **Human decision authority preserved**: All voice preservation vs. technical accuracy trade-offs require human judgment

### üéØ Technical Precision vs. Voice Fidelity Framework
- **Flag conflicts immediately**: When technical accuracy improvements conflict with voice preservation, stop and flag rather than proceed
- **Present options with preservation bias**: "I can improve technical accuracy, but this would change your original phrasing. Should I preserve your voice or optimize for accuracy?"
- **No autonomous voice modification**: AI cannot improve technical precision by modifying preserved voice without explicit permission

### üìã Conflict Escalation Protocols
- **Preserve original by default**: When uncertain, maintain voice preservation over technical optimization
- **Explicit conflict notification**: "I notice a tension between preserving your exact phrasing and technical accuracy here..."
- **Choice preservation**: Always provide human with option to maintain original voice even if technically suboptimal

## Validation Criteria

**Voice preservation oath implementation:** Sacred principle applied with archaeological respect for original intelligence. 

**Behavioral requirements compliance:** Voice preservation commandments followed to prevent AI drift and tone overlays.

**Archaeological extraction verification:** Intelligence discovered from existing content, never generated or summarized.

**Surgical precision verification:** Voice preservation maintained while removing only bureaucratic bloat that serves no archaeological purpose.

## üîå Voice Override Port

FloatPrompt allows external voice guides to override system-level defaults.
Use a single optional field in JSON frontmatter:
```json
{
  "voice_override": "support/voice/my-voice.md"
}
```
**Behavior:** If file exists and loads successfully, use it. If file missing or fails to load, gracefully fall back to system voice defaults.
