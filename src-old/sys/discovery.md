## Enable Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks Through Discovery Intelligence

Apply discovery intelligence fields to create relationship awareness and emergent knowledge navigation across floatprompt networks.

## ðŸ”— Discovery Intelligence Fields

Enable self-organizing knowledge networks through relationship awareness:

<!-- INJECT: discovery-template.json -->
```

### ðŸŒŠ Soft-Coded Philosophy
All discovery fields use **emergent, human-defined values**:
- No enums or preset categories
- Values emerge from actual usage patterns
- AI and humans collaborate to evolve vocabulary
- System grows organically with intellectual territory

## Validation Criteria

See "Validate FloatPrompt Compliance Through Deployment Checklist" section for comprehensive validation requirements covering discovery metadata compliance.

Discovery fields implementation: Complete discovery intelligence schema applied with all relationship, navigation, temporal, clustering, and essence fields included. Soft-coded philosophy compliance: Emergent human-defined values used without enums or preset categories. Template version provided: TODO placeholders included for new floatprompt creation. Knowledge network enablement: Self-organizing relationship awareness and navigation guidance implemented throughout field structure.
